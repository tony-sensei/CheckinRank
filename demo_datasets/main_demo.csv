159651,"Pretty sure this place doesn't exist. If you go to the address there's just student housing. ||| Seems that there's only one regular that goes to the lounge. People come during random hours of the night ||| WHERE IS THIS PLACE??? The address led me to university housing and I was sorely disappointed by the lack of a lounge...I'll reform my rating when I can actually locate this place. ||| Oatmeal was very high quality, and great service. However, I was slightly disappointed in the lack of toppings. Overall, a great experience in breakfast cuisine, and available whenever I want! Love the new 24-hour schedule. ||| Best oatmeal in town. Open 24 hours too. Ask for the special, and you won't be disappointed",5.0,266.0,67100.0,35.6

It is always a pleasure doing business with this location! ||| Wanted to get food really late one day and they were closed. Very frustrating to have the place say 24/hrs and then not even be open. ||| This WaWa served me a turkey hoagie with a 2 inch bolt and 2 washers inside my hoagie! I will never eat there again! Glenolden WAWa on macdade Blvd. ||| Less crowded and more efficient and organized than my regular location on Columbus Bl in Phila.",5.0,29.0,96649.0,1.24
37206,"Man kept making saying words to me in Spanish because I was Mexican and made fun of my accent ||| Always an easy, quick way to order subway close to our hose. Friendly staff both in the subway restaurant and the gas station. Very conscientious, happy and recommend! ||| Not enforcing mask rules. I will pass the word around. ||| Stopped in for a quick sandwich to-go. Ordered the foot-long Italian B.M.T. and since we live nearby, the sandwich was still hot and delicious when we got home.  We asked for our sandwich toppings on the side with Subway's salad dressing.  Everything was packed perfectly and as we requested. Kudos to the cook.

This Subway is located in a Shell station so there was free parking and easy in and out. ||| I always get the same sandwich when I go to a subway , however with this location , Probably one of the most awful tasting sandwiches I've had. Toasted for like 5 seconds chicken had a rubber texture. Wouldn't recommend.",5.0,17.0,165089.0,182.5
64002,"The more unique items on the menu are the best, especially the burgers. The Bavarian Burger rocks as does the one on the Pretzel bun. The Greek salad with chicken is awesome and all of their salads are HUGE as well as their chocolate cake! ||| This reminded us of an Irish TGI Friday's.  The food was decent, the service was nice.  I can't say much more about this location right now.  Nothing really stood out as being really good or really bad. ||| Home of the $3 fish bowl margaritas and Romines Chicken. This is a great place for a group of friends to go for a reasonable meal and drinks.. ||| there so called 'malones' fried chicken isnt malones fried chicken, but its the closest you will ever get! ||| Staff was friendly, but that was the best part.  The food was just okay. The restaurant should invest in new menus, the age and quality of the ones they use make the place less appealing.",5.0,32.0,88260.0,3.9400000000000004
61608,"Great place to stop to grab a gyro or chicken to eat during a long commute. Attentive staff and good select for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. ||| This place has some of the best food I've found around here. And their new smoothie menu is to die for. Do yourself a favor and try the Passion Fruit and Lychee smoothie{A4). You'll thank me later. ||| Amazing fried chicken and french fries. Very friendly service. This place is great because they carry Mexican candy that you can't find elsewhere ||| Very good chicken, i ordered chicken tender meal came with 1 side and a biscuit. Nice market i never been almost like a wawa , very clean and even sells fresh bait ||| Great place with great prices. They also have very good coffee. Cannot beat their fresh made breakfast sandwiches",5.0,61.0,133874.0,4.130000000000001
139389,"My Dad and I stopped by here on the way through town. The food is what you can expect from Subway which are reasonably priced subs. The location is clean with friendly service and plenty of seating. ||| I have eaten here several times.. friendly people and they keep it stocked well ||| Always well made subs and the ingredients are fresh. People are friendly and the dining are is clean. ||| Absolutely SUCKS!! Barely put a teaspoon of tuna on my sandwich, was told that was normal now. Owned by foreigners that only care about making and extra .30 cents per sandwich instead of making it like any other normal subway. Do yourself a favor and go to Jersey Mike's,  you would get 6 times the amount of tuna on one of their sandwiches.
See pic ||| Nice and efficient staff. The veggies are very fresh and the bread is soft. This is the yummiest Subway I have been to!",5.0,144.0,129369.0,0.84

98112,"Love their hamburgers & fries.  Cheap & good! ||| I can't even rate this... This is one restaurant that screams frozen food section.The customer service was decent but the food is sloppy
. they put too much condiments on the burgers which was a major turn off.. I don't recommend eating there unless u want a quick cheap menu item deal. ||| The food tastes good for what it is but for some reason it's always almost cold by the time I get home. Even the foil paper wrapped burgers. ||| Well I am speechless,  they finally fixed the junky leaning in the mud tables and put em on concrete.  5 stars just for that alone!! Oh the foods good too.. but seriously  the tables ||| I remember why I don't do Rally's after I eat it. My belly is hurting so bad from all of the grease. Why do I do this to myself???????",5.0,83.0,82858.0,0.8300000000000001
