49497,"I heard about Raising Cane's via Louisiana friends who sang praises of the joint. While in NOLA (and surrounding suburbs) my companions and I spotted several RCs and after driving around for sometime we decided to stop in to see what all the fuss was about.

Menu: reminiscent of California's favorite burger joint, In-n-Out. The menu is basic and doesn't offer many options. If my memory serves me correctly you have 3-4 combos to choose from. The combo is dependent upon the  # of chicken strips you want. A combo includes fries, drink, coleslaw, Texas toast and chicken strips.

Customer service: We were greeted when we walked in and promptly addressed when our food was ready. My one complaint: the cashier asked if I wanted lemonade or a fountain drink for my drink choice and I chose lemonade. I saw the lemonade behind the counter but didn't think anything about it when she gave me my cup. I went to get my lemonade from the fountain and realized there wasn't any lemonade. I decided to get sweet tea instead. However, after looking at my receipt I saw that I was charged an additional $0.30 for lemonade. I normally don't make fusses at restaurants, but this time I decided to get what I paid for. When I asked the cashier if there was a charge for lemonade her quick reply was, ""Yeah, I charged you for it, but forgot to give you the lemonade."" I don't understand why she waited so long to fix her mistake. It's just lemonade, but had I not checked my receipt or went back to claim my lemonade I would have missed out on the tasty lemonade from Raising Cane's.

Drinks: Lemonade: sweet, tart, and everything lemonade is supposed to be. Sweet tea: ok. Nothing to spectacular. McDonald's and Chick-Fil-A offer better sweet tea.

Food: Nothing to tweet or write home about. The fries were bland. Coleslaw was not bad! I usually skip coleslaw unless it's from KFC, but RCs slaw was pretty tasty! Texas toast: warm, soft, and slightly buttery. I've never had Texas toast with sesame seeds, and most of my Texas toast tastings have been on the super buttery garlic side. The chicken strips were okay, but  tasted better with RCs special sauce. My companions and I tried to decipher the ingredients and we guessed ketchup, mayo, mustard, paprika, pepper, and salt. When it comes to fast food chicken and chicken strips, Chick-Fil-A has this delicacy on point. Raising Cane's does a good job, but they can't nab the gold.

Prices: I paid $7.99 (including tax) for a massive drink, 4 chicken strips, toasted Texas toast, cole slaw, and fries. Can't beat that price!

Overall: Solid food, affordable prices, convenient. ||| You know the chicken fingers were fine nothing to special. The only reason why I'm writing a review is the dirty marketing behind Raising Canes, The Three Finger Combo! Walking through that lackluster mall, Raising Canes gave me a good chuckle and a beautiful picture. Eat here just for the humor. ||| As a California native, I can honestly say I wish we had a Cane's. I like it better than Popeye's and the price is great too. I ordered ""The Box"" combo with double-buttered toast and it totaled to less than $10. I wish I could have went here one more time before leaving NOLA. ||| The chicken fingers are pretty good. The seasoned fries are great. Just like any fried chicken places. ( KFC, POPEYE'S, etc..) ||| I was stuck at the mall with a hungry five year old, and she wanted chicken fingers. I can't figure out why this chain is so popular, the chicken fingers don't seem to be anything special to me, but my daughter put them away like there was no tomorrow. 

The service was surprisingly friendly for a New Orleans fast food place. The ""Cane Sauce"" seems to be the only part of the meal that is above average. It has a nice spicy vinegar flavor, that goes well with the chicken and the french fries. Other than that, this place is thoroughly average. ||| I know its fast food but I love this place. I only get it once a year and I feel pretty unhealthy after I eat it but it's totally worth it. Their sauce is my kryptonite! I always order several extra cups and save it for when we eat crawfish later on our trip. It's perfect for dipping crawfish tails. There is something about that chicken, toast, crinkle cut fries and orange soda that just makes me smile (and my arteries clog). $7-8 on a caniac? Money well spent!",6,76,111491,2.3099999999999996
120462,"Almost every time I order something, it comes out wrong. I asked for a veggie egg white on a bagel with bacon, when I went to eat it, no bacon. A few times before that I ordered a bacon egg and cheese, once again no bacon. I have been charged both times for things that I did not get. Very disappointed. ||| Worst Dunkin on the East Coast.  I go to a lot of Dunkins. This one does a lot of business but .....  Coffee is good but I have to repeat my order multiple times. 

I have gotten stale English muffins, items barely toasted or not toasted when I specifically say toasted. 

Always have to ask for napkins or a carrier. ||| Seriously get an order right for once. Been there twice in the past two weeks and they gave me the wrong order both times. If you read the other reviews in this place they pretty much describe what your experience will be like at this place. ||| Worst Dunkin' Donuts I have ever been to in my life. Staff is ridiculous. Drive through is a disaster. ||| If you're in Phoenixville don't go to this Dunkin' Donuts.  I went in to buy a couple coffee decided not to ever come back. Horrible service.... ||| The service stinks at this location they have traffic in the drive through all the way back to the street they always get orders wrong the Management's attitude stinks are you kidding me you're running a business should be shut down for the lousy service you produce the so-called hot food is cold they're always running out of donuts what in the world very pitiful Dunkin Donuts to say the least you ought to be shut down they need to put a Starbucks there ||| They refuse to open the inside because they don't want to yet Covid has lifted restrictions and we should be allowed to order inside. It causes for a backed up drive through everyday and long lines. My drinks are always poor quality due to the wait ||| Why would anybody go to this Dunkin' Donuts. This is by far the worst Dunkin' Donuts I have every been to.People  that work there are ignorant. ||| Just handed $50.00 to reload my phone app. They screwed up. I have receipt in hand. Refusing to refund my money as it is not on my card. Want me to call customer service when i have not even left the property. ||| Coffee tastes like they don't clean the equipment well. I also got really sick after eating an breakfast sandwich. ||| The worst Dunkin Donuts I've ever been to! They got my coffee wrong at the drive thru but I ignored it then they told me to pull forward because my bagel with cream cheese want ready yet!?! I waited and waited and no one came with my bagel. 
So I went into the store with my wrong coffee and told them to refund me my money because I didn't get anything I ordered. The manager was rude and rolled his eyes, I almost leaped over the counter. Never will i ever go here again!!! ||| Bagel was burned and they were light on the cream cheese.  Donuts were just ok.  Disappointed to say the least! ||| If you want to wait in line for 20 minutes, be ignored and then get the wrong order, this is the place for you! I've heard multiple people complain about the service here and same type of problems! ||| Our first time back since they remodeled and reopened. It's a great location at intersection next to hospital. Service is quick and friendly. ||| Good coffee. Good service. Never a problem inside, quasi-Efficient drive thru and clean restroom. Drive thru always forgets napkins ||| Great staff, Mary rocks!   Only downfall is the drive thru clogs traffic in the am, I wish they could keep the cars moving through faster, on more than one occasion I was detected from pulling in because I could get into the lot ||| Drive thru is extremely slow. They always have this one woman work the drive thru in the morning (aka the busiest time) and she's always so confused and takes forever to ring up orders. The line goes out into the street when she works the drive thru, otherwise it's fine when she's not at the drive thru ||| I love going through the drive-thru in the morning as they are very fast. However, today I went into the store and the older woman ringing up our orders was extremely rude and made me feel like an idiot when I tried explaining the drink to her that I wanted (it's the new Pumpkin Macchiato) but couldn't remember the name of it. But we established that we wanted 2 hot pumpkin macchiatos. Several minutes later we got the iced ones instead. I politely told them that we ordered hot ones and the kid that served them to us went over to her and asked and she practically yelled ""No, she told me that she wanted iced."" It was humiliating. Regardless, I've put up with this particular woman before and she's never been that kind, but today was definitely the worst. I'm going to start driving up the road to Wawa now for coffee. ||| I always go to this location and have had good and bad experiences but pretty much the good out weighs the bad!! First of all, what I like is that I am in here sooo much that they already know what I want when I come in and there is like zero waiting time even on their busiest days and they can get quite busy especially from 6am-8:30am. At busy and peak times the parking lot can get a bit chaotic and at times almost disastrous!! ||| Place is a joke.  They mess up your orders and don't admit to there failure.  You call for a manger and always an excuse why they are not there or they so happen to leave. Don't waist your time going here. Beyond poor service ||| Why does anyone come to this store?  You never get what you asked for.  They just give you what they want to and hope that you drive away.  I will never patronize this location again. ||| Terrible Dunkin' compared to every other one I have been to.  Incorrect orders constantly. ||| I hate this Dublin donut location. Banning students from 2-4 in the afternoon, is stupid!!! Just because two students got in a fight doesn't mean the other students have something to do with it.!!! This Dunkin is going to lose business if they keep doing this.  they told us we could stay if we bought something and after buying some drink they kicked us out!! What a shame. It's only a one star because i have to rate.... ||| All this place does is serve up DISAPPOINTMENT BLEND. Brown, transparent piss water is all you're going to get here. It used to be decent here but over the last few years when the younger Indian guy became manager it has gone DOWNHILL. All the manager does is try to hit on girls all the time. It's gross. It's horrendous. If you want dunkin, go up the road to the new one near mowere road. They at least have their shit together a little more. ||| I only bought a cup of coffee and decided not to come back any more. The employees are so unprofessional and impolite. It is the worst Dunkin Donuts I have ever tried. ||| No. I work for DoorDash and got into an argument about an order they made wrong for one of my customers. The customer ordered the Snackin' bacon. The item they put in the bag is not the snackin' bacon. It was a sandwich. I pointed out to them this order was wrong and the employee got irate with me. I even showed them what the order said and pointed it out on their menu. They told me to leave. 

If I could avoid picking up from there for a while that would be super. They really need to retrain people or hire people who actually care. This guy clearly does not. ||| I'm so sick of the new lady working the morning drive through I believe her name is Ginny. no matter how many questions she asks about my coffee it still turns out fucked up. And the lines are much longer than usual because of her. PLEASE put her back on night shift. ||| I wouldn't say I've had an amazing experience here but I've never had a bad one. I prefer this location over the newer one near Mowere road. They always make my iced coffee perfectly and usually i mobile order and skip the line so i don't have to deal with the employees that much. On the few occasions i have they have been polite and accommodating and they usually recognize me when i come in to pick up my order. I wish the parking lot and drive through were set up better but i generally frequent it when it isn't too busy. ||| I decided to go in because the drive-thru line was horrendous. I walk in and nobody was in line. I wait a bit at the counter, the workers are rummaging around. Finally someone came up to the counter to take my order. I asked for a large caramel frozen coffee with a turbo shot, and whip cream.  I use my app to pay. I didn't even look at my receipt, and when my number was called I told the gentleman I didn't order a small. The lady at the register yelled, ""she used a coupon!"" And I explained that I did not use a coupon, and it wasn't what I ordered. Ridiculous. ||| Waited 20 minutes for 1 sandwich which came out completely wrong. Steer clear of this place. ||| Lady who took my order at the drive through window was patient and kind.  The guy at the window was friendly and kind.  I wonder if his quietness is misunderstood.  

They got our order right and gave us plenty of napkins.  I ordered the beyond sausage with only the English muffin and they gave me an extra patty since I didn't get egg or cheese. ||| I ordered a medium iced americano, and it was warm with no ice, it had all melted. Apparently their recipe calls for just enough ice to make the drink not ""hot.""

They did not know what half and half was, and thought I wanted half skim and half whole milk. I said no, just a plain americano will be fine. 

Visit your local coffee shop instead! Artisans! Soltane! ||| Since I'm forced to give a star to make this review I will but, I give it a 0/5! This is the WORST dunkin donuts I've ever been too! Every single time I go there they get my order wrong even if it's just a coffee! Also the tall guy that looks bucked tooth beaver is as stupid as they come, ask him a question and all he does is mumble like a jack ass!! ||| When you are ordering at the drive thru try to be clear as this person ""Mohamed"" is in a big rush and doesn't listen very well.  Just double check your order people",34,139,121166,34.02
64269,"To the point, the sushi and service blows away the competition (kyoto, ninja, and sushi house). Take out is extremely convenient and eating in has yet to disappoint. If you're in the valley area, sushiman makes for a great casual sushi experience.

On a side note, i take offense to Maddie M.'s earlier review. Her immature and vulgar language describing the resturant and cuisine left me compelled to join yelp and disagree with her review. ||| Ever since they first opened, I have always loved the food. They are reasonably priced, and the sushi is certainly some of the best in the area. Their customer service is excellent as well; they recently updated their lunch special after I asked. Certainly would recommend this to everyone, as I do. ||| So this is our new favorite sushi place.  But you can't give a local sushi restaurant five stars when they are competing with the likes of Morimoto downtown.  If there was a category of local sushi restaurants, I'd give it five stars, no question.  But...  

Regardless, the ordinary selection of sushi came flawlessly presented, with generous portions and reasonable prices.  My wife's selection of rolls on both occasions pleased her no end.  My eccentric combinations came artfully prepared and everything as fresh as I've had anywhere.  The soups are well made, the broth authentic.  I'm afraid I'd ding them a bit for greasy tempura.  I suspect they need to increase the heat of the oil a bit.  OK with me, I don't eat it.  Well, only a little, snagged from my wife's plate.

It's close, service is great, prices are good, what more do you want in a local sushi joint? ||| Great food and wonderful service.
We were here for lunch and had sashimi and sushi rolls.
Beautiful presentation. ||| Variety!!!! I was pleasantly surprised with Sushiman.  It's a great BYOB, with a sushi menu like I have never seen. So many options of special and chef rolls. If you like sushi there will be something here for you! 

My only complaint was the wait, which seemed a little long even though they were busy. 

Friendly staff, and sushi was delicious! I got the dynamite roll and the mango roll which were great! I would definitely recommend as the best sushi in the burbs. ||| Went for a family members birthday. It was excellent. Food was great......not just the sushi. Rock Shrimp was a major hit off the appetizer menu along with chicken fried rice. Byob as well which is always a win. Plenty of parking in front and back of restaurant ||| I was in a hurry to pick up some dinner as I was leaving the hair salon over the weekend and my hair dresser recommended Sushiman. It worked out because I was craving sushi anyway. 
For being a small restaurant on the strip mall area of Huntington Pike, there was actually plenty of parking. Really easy to navigate your way to the entrance too. 
Once I got inside and made it to the front desk, I was greeted by a little boy and a woman who was helping him ring up orders. I was placing a take out order. I picked up a menu and began deciding what I would get for my boyfriend and I. We got two orders of Godzilla roll, one Philadelphia roll, two orders of Rock N Roll, and one sweet potato roll. All of them were terrific! My favorite was the Godzilla roll. Every roll we had was fresh and tasty. I can't thank the staff enough for packaging everything so nicely secure to ensure there was no spillage. The soy sauce made it back home perfectly fine. 

I wish we could have dined in, but because the food was so good, we will definitely have to come here on a separate occasion to eat in. It's also BYOB. Looking forward to our next meal at Sushiman! ||| Absolutely delicious!!! Great location with beautiful decor and great service. The food was some of the best, freshest & good portioned Japanese I've had in a long time. It's nice to have such good quality food at a great price in this location. Defiantly a few MUST HAVES: tuna pizza, we ordered a second one because it is that good, tom yam soup (perfect amount of spice best I've had) & the crispy spicy tuna roll. We will be going back at least once a week! Fantastic BYOB date or family spot! ||| The staff is very nice, but the food was just okay. 

My friend ordered three rolls and our waitress only gave her two. I would expect her to offer a free roll or do something to make up for her mistake, but all she said was that it would be another ten minutes if my friend still wanted a roll. 

The garden salad was delicious- much nicer and tasted better than the other sushi restaurants in the area. 

The sushi rolls were presented in a really pretty design and had lots of garnish!

Would've also liked to see a 2 for $20 option similar to the other restaurants in the area. ||| Very reasonable pricing on very delicious sushi. I'd been to quite a few sushi places in the area with my girlfriend and Sushiman is quickly becoming one of our favorites. The rolls are all fairly priced  and you get a lot of food for the price you're paying. 

The only complaint is the wait time between ordering and receiving your food. It took quite a long time - though there were tons of people ordering for pickup and I assume that even though the restaurant was fairly empty the orders for pickup were called in ahead of our arrival. In any case, I'd still recommend this location! ||| So delicious best sushi! I've ordered a few times during COVID and you just go and pick up. Service  is nice and during warmer days they also have outdoor seating ||| I have one place that I really enjoy the sushi and stick with what I know, but this place wow. The sushi was delicious. I will definitely be making my way to come here again. I got the shrimp tempura roll and spicy crab roll and it was delicious! So happy I came and tried. I came back multiple times after my first time. My ultimate favorite roll is the sappro roll! It's delicious! ||| I have one place that I really enjoy the sushi and stick with what I know, but this place wow. The sushi was delicious. I will definitely be making my way to come here again. I got the shrimp tempura roll and spicy crab roll and it was delicious! So happy I came and tried it out. ||| We weren't really impressed with the sushi quality. The rolls were messy anfd fell apart. The quality wasn't that great either. The spicy tuna didn't taste right and wasn't how I was expecting. I wasn't expecting grounded tuna with spicy sauce mixed in; the texture was not appetizing nor was the flavor. We didn't eat about half of our rolls because they weren't good. This was the first time we have ordered from here and there were good reviews. I'm wondering if the sushi is better when eaten in the restaurant as opposed to takeout. We probably won't go back because of the poor quality. ||| Very clean bright place, sushi Taste fresh and good presentation.

I got 'Foxy Lady' and the cooked eel roll ||| This new sushi joint is a welcome gem for the area. The service is awesome and the food is excellent !!!!! Thanks Sushiman we will definitely be back!!!!!!!!! ||| Cute sushi place!! My cousin brought me here last night and I'm so happy she did because I could eat here everyday! The quality of the food is really good and it is affordable. This is our new found sushi place! ||| Fabulous restaurant!  Delicious sushi, nice atmosphere, and great service.  Will definitely be back again soon! ||| I've had some hits and misses here. They're a half price sushi place, and I always appreciate that. Usually the food is of good quality, but I've ran into some soggy, chewy nori with their rolls here. Also, strangely enough I have had issues here with other dining patrons being aggressive and obnoxious which is unusual - this isn't the restaurant's fault, but it's very odd. I haven't had any issues with the staff and service is usually fine, but the clientele that comes here makes it uncomfortable to dine in. Once again, I have no idea why this is, but on two separate occasions there have been issues with other groups causing a huge disturbance in the restaurant. And FYI, it's always been on a Sunday afternoon, not a rip-roaring Saturday night or anything. Oh well, I guess it's take out only for me from now on. ||| This place is my new favorite sushi house, I went twice in one week. It's so cute inside, the servers are so nice, they play Today's hits and their food is so good!!! Did I mention it's really affordable too? If you like sushi that doesn't break your bank definitely try them! ||| A sushi oasis where you would not expect to find excellent sushi. Quality is always great and price is very reasonable for what you get. I've eaten in (pre pandemic) and taken out and have never once been disappointed. ||| The food sucks donkey butt i got a crispy spicy tuna roll and the tuna tasted like fucking canned tuna. it wasnt spicy at all it was actually sweet. The only thing that i liked that they didnt mess up was the side dish of white rice ||| Our new favorite!! Excellent food, ample portions, very nice atmosphere and staff!! Super clean and relaxing!!! Love love love ||| The sushi tastes good, fresh, and when you put it in your mouth it tastes amazing, but when I ate it my bathroom exploded because it had one thing that made me sick. I don't know what it was, so it does not get 5 stars. ||| On three different occasions I have walked in and sat at the Sushi Bar. The variety, taste and quality on the Sushi Deluxe is outstanding. They look to have a variety of excellent rolls as well. The portions are a nice size and their ginger is very fresh. 

Definitely recommend. ||| My favorite sushi place. The rolls are delicious and fairly priced. The staff is always kind and efficient.  It is a 30 minute drive and we pass several sushi places on our way, but it is worth it.  Highly recommend. ||| So I decided to try this place after seeing 2 advertisements for this place. I figure for 50% off sushi for their Grand Opening, it couldn't hurt to try. I have tried a couple other places in the area, The newer Makiman at 5 points (also the original Makiman from the 90's ), Ooka, and a couple other places in the Abington area. This is the closest sushi place. I love that it is a small place in a area with local shops around it. I prefer to support local businesses.

So we ordered green tea, edamame, several rolls, including some regular rolls, chef specialties, standard chicken teriyaki, and mochi.

-Green tea was good. Kind of unremarkable, but nice and light. It is unsweetened and doesn't taste watered down.
-Edamame was good. Appeared and tasted fresh. Otherwise, unremarkable.
-Miso soup was very good. Better than the SushiHouse in Jenkintown and on par with Ooka in terms of flavor. Just Miso soup with seaweed and tofu. I really did like their miso soup as it reminds me of the ""original"" Makiman at 5 points, which made very flavorful soup. Most miso soups at other local joints tend to be weak.
Salad was very good. Dressing was not bland and had a lot of flavor. Again, the dressing was better than Sushi House. Strong ginger flavor, more than I am use too. But I still enjoyed it.
--Rolls were good. Not the best I have ever had, but certainly not the worst. We paid 50% for all the rolls, so given the price and specialty rolls that we ordered, it was a great bang for your buck meal. I ordered a bunch of eel rolls, and the eels tasted good. Eel sauce was good, not overly sweet, and not overly strong. It had a very subtle flavor compared to some other places. All rolls we ordered tasted fresh.
-Chicken Teriyaki was very good. Chicken was cooked perfect. Not dry. The chicken teriyaki is better here than at Ooka. Ooka chicken tends to be more dry. This chicken was moist and cooked very well. Sushiman I got 2 chix breast on a bed of vegetables (broccoli, onions, zuchinni, mushrooms, and carrots). Vegetables are basically boiled and otherwise unremarkable. The sauce was very good. It is light, not thick. Slight sweetness, but not over powering like their eel sauce.
-Mochi was good. Again, not as good as Ooka mochi, but much better than store bought mochi.

Decor is modern and not really culturally based, but I don't come here for the decor. Restaurant was clean and well lit.

Service was great. The servers did an excellent job. They were very attentive and fast. Got refills before needing it. They aren't hawking over our table like they do at SushiHouse in Jenkintown, but they are paying attention to what is happening at our table. Servers were polite and pleasant. Took accurate orders. Very satisfied with the service.

So again, this place may not taste as good as Ooka, but they are also closer to us and the prices were excellent. Even without the 50% discount, prices are still reasonable and better than Ooka. We left with full stomachs with good food. I would not hesitate to come back here again. It just a shame that it is in a place that does not get a lot of volume, as I think this place would do much better in a better location. It would be nice to see this place take over the SushiHouse in Jenkintown, so that they can do better business cause I would be happy to see them stay in business. ||| During COVID, I've ordered from sushiman multiple times. The food is so good here that I order at least once a week. I definitely recommend the hibachi dinners. It comes with soup, salad and 2 pieces of shrimp. As well as the Huntingdon roll. ||| Upside: Delicious and well priced menu. Friendly customer service, convenient location with ample parking space, clean and pleasant environment in the facility. 

Downside: they don't deliver. ||| Everything was so fresh and prepared to order. It took some time for the sushi to hit the table, but made sense because it was prepared so fresh! This was one of the sushi spots that I have been to that actually has big portion size and the rolls are tight and not falling apart. 

My sister suggested this spot for dinner one night and it was a winner in my book! Besides the sushi which was very tasty and filling, they served hibachi so my 7 year old could enjoy dinner as well. 

The sushi menu was huge and there were so many different types of rolls to choose from, it was difficult choosing just a few. 

The interior of the building is very open, and clean. The staff are friendly and helpful and really good at their jobs. They gave us a heads up that it would take some time to get the sushi out so we enjoyed the time waiting by sipping on some wine, since its BYOB- which is always a good thing! ||| A solid five star, their Miso soup is very flavorful, their prices are reasonable for the area and their sushi rolls are absolutely delicious. They also have great customer service. 

We have been here twice is about a month period and I think we might be switching from the sushi house in Abington to here! Nothing that we have ordered so far has been bad. 

Also kid friendly! ||| Very good sushi and reasonable prices! Spent an evening there with my family and they were fans, also. ||| What a fabulous meal! I have very high standards for sushi and Sushiman exceeded them all. Their prices are SO REASONABLE. Most things were $1-3 cheaper than what I'm used to, so I loved that. I ordered 3 salmon avocado rolls, 1 eel avocado roll, 1 spicy salmon crunchy roll, 1 crispy CA roll, and 1 pan fried noodle beef dish. The rolls were generously PACKED with fish and avocado and wrapped with a very thin layer of rice. This shows that they aren't ripping you off. Some places try to fill you up with rice and are skimpy with the inside contents; Sushiman did not do that! The salmon was tender and fresh with great flavor and the avocado was perfectly ripe. The crispy CA roll was delicious and packed with so many different textures and flavors. I usually don't go for special rolls because they tend to be too expensive but this roll was only $5.95 (original price used to be $11.95) so I had to give it a try. My favorite part of that roll was the caviar topping. They put on a ton!! 
I do have other, less outstanding, comments to say though... the pan fried noodle beef dish tasted like it was from a cheap Chinese restaurant. Personally, I love that, but do be warned that their sushi is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the noodles. The beef was pretty tough too. But it still tasted great the next morning cold. Lastly, when I was picking up I parked in the front of the restaurant. Unfortunately, it was raining and I had to walk around to the back of the restaurant. So, just be aware that you should park in the back and not the front. Anyway, I loved this place and I cannot wait to go back again. ||| Outstanding fresh fish and service. The Sushi Pizza and Sushi sandwich is a must. Salmon tartar is topped with a quail egg - totally over the top. This is my new ""go to"" and I feel tops BlueFin Sushi in East Norriton. ||| Previously Deflopee, now a Japanese restaurant. BYOB.
Sushi is fresh, place is very clean and service is good. ||| Absolutely love sushi man! Me and my boyfriend order or go in atleast once a week, the prices are great. ||| Great sashimi rolls but where the hell do you get your water from. It is soapy or do you do it on purpose to get customers to order sparkling water. Try your sushi rolls with sparkling water they are horrible. CHANGE WATER SUPPLY OR YOU WOULD GET SOMEONE TO TEST IT FOR YOU!!! ||| This is my favorite half off sushi spot. They probably the best in terms of quality for half off sushi spots. 

The sushi is good and I've haven't had a bad roll. I don't like spicy salmon rolls or anything of the sort because of the texture. But this is the only place I would order it from and actually enjoy eating. I've dine in and ordered takeout from this place multiple times and the quality is consistently good. Service is average. When the place is full, the sushi does take longer but it's expected. ||| Amazing sushi restaurant. The best in the area, and trust me when i tell you that we've been to almost all of the sushi places in the Northeast, Huntington Valley, and Warminster.  Sushi X is a close second to this place in terms of quality and price. However, this restaurant is nicely adorned, and inviting.  Rolls were amazing!  Took a little longer to receive our order, but that's the price of perfection.  Stop reading this review and bookmark this place. ||| Definitely the best Asian food around here. They have everything you'd expect from a average Asian restaurant, but they also have EXQUISITE sushi. I love their sushi there. I usually get the Philadelphia roll and the pink lady. It's very cheap because apparently the grand opening just keeps on going. Nice atmosphere inside, but a bit smaller then average inside. Also not much room for parking. ||| We've been looking for a replacement to our favorite sushi place since it closed about 3 years ago- and after MANY attempts we finally found it!!! This BYOB has a great selection of sushi at excellent prices. The variety and creativity on their menu is not something we have seen in other sushi restaurants. The attentiveness of the staff was great. We will definitely be back soon! ||| Sushi is very good. Staff is always very friendly and provide great vegan options for my annoying wife. ||| This is my favorite sushi place. My boyfriend and I have been here multiple times and we have always had a pleasant experience. While, I love sushi, my boyfriend is not a fan and they also have good non-sushi items, such as their teriyaki selections.  If I had to suggest one item from the menu, it would be the hibachi noodles. It is a delicious side order that is definitely a hidden gem. ||| Our local go to Sushi restaurant. The chef/ owner, Jackie is a master with Sushi. He is constantly creating new dishes and flavors. We often sit at the Sushi bar, strong choice if there are busy. Your generally served rather quickly at the bar. We have enjoyed many meals and find there food to be good quality, beautifully prepared and very reasonable. They also have a full kitchen and their cooked choices are also a strong choice. Their business has grown nicely, very busy on weekends so we often go during the week. In our opinion, no reason to go any where else foe Sushi. ||| Amazing place with great food. The presentation of our seafood salad and two tuna dishes was fantastic. All five stars!!! ||| Food is high quality, fish is always fresh. They have a huge selection of reasonably priced sushi. The Veg Dragon Roll is awesome and different from other places I have tried. The vegetable Pad Thai is especially good (lots of fresh veggies in there not just the typical onion and carrot overload). They haven't changed the decor much inside from previous owners. My only complaint is the wait, they frequently quote 15 or 20 minutes wait times for pick up. My food has only been ready once in the quoted time frame. Give them an extra 10 minutes more than they tell you, and your food will be ready. ||| I really like the sushi here better than a lot of the places around here....they have so many different types of sushi rolls and the place is comfortable and friendly...also brought young kids with us before and they were good with them and gave them they're own training chop sticks ||| My boyfriend and i's new favorite spot! Great service and the sushi is delicious! Ever since our favorite spot closed the past 2 years I have been hunting for a good new spot and this place does it for me! Prices are not skyrocketing and the rolls are delicious.

Only advice is Saturday when we went for dinner gets super busy. I've been for lunch and it's great! ||| When it comes to sushi, i only care about one thing, thats freshness. This place has it. Fresh clean kind staff. Great pricing. All in all a great experience ||| First time here, definitely will be coming back. 
The interior is clean and well decorated. The staff VERY friendly and accomodating. 

As far as the food- Miso soup was solid. Fried calamari was amazing and the sushi tasted very fresh. 

The only downside, the spicy tuna and wasabi were lacking in the spice department. ||| I was my daughter's (elite yelper) plus one to a magic show held by elite yelpers. After the great show, we were still hungry. So went decided to go to this restaurant. 
We were seated right away. My daughter went to the bathroom. Upon returning from the bathroom to our table , we both noticed that the floor is a bit sticky. Our shoes were making sticky sound on the floor while walking. We did place our order. We ordered only 4 sushi rolls. Our wait for our dinner was quite long., about 45 min. The sushi tasted good! But not impressive. 
On the way out there was a division zig zag screen, not sure of the purpose. They also had a white board and black board but the special were very hard to read. The outside was lighted nicely with white  lights. I would not return to this restaurant. The restaurant is out of the way for me. ||| I ordered two large party trays. The rolls/sushi tasted great. I did not eat inside but just take out. So I can't say how friendly the staff is but when I walked in it did look clean. ||| To be honest, I didn't have high expectations for this place. Just went here one night last minute for a quick bite. I was very impressed and will definitely be back! 

Sushi was fresh and delicious and service was top notch, what more can you ask for? The menu is very extensive, it was hard to just pick a few things to order! As if the menu wasn't intimidating enough, there is a long list of specials that all sound amazing. Specials included appetizers and rolls. 

Highly recommend ordering off the special menu - I will be back to try more from it! Also, don't hesitate asking your waitress for her suggestion, if you have any doubts. I had a couple questions about the menu and asked for a recommendation and I am so glad I did! We were convinced to try ""happy tuna"" appetizer and it was my favorite thing we ordered! (See picture) ||| went a few nights ago with a friend. Atmosphere was nice, spacious, quiet and very clean. The waitresses were very attentive and our cups were never empty. We ordered a few rolls, which were delicious! The fish was so fresh and portions generous. The menu is vast, with so many choices and options of different sized portions of each, so you can try a few pieces of multiple rolls. Pricing was competitive with the better sushi places in the area. I would say based on my visit that this is probably the best place for sushi within several miles now. ||| If you are looking for the best and freshest sushi around then Sushiman is the place.  
Sushi is always fresh, and served with a beautiful presentation.  Great BYOB spot where you are not rushed, and they food comes when you are ready, not when they are ready to serve it.  
My favorite is the fresh scallops served on a bed of shaved ice with thinly sliced lemon!  Don't be afraid to try it!  It is amazing!
Tuna pizza, yellowtail jalapeno and the lollipop rolls are always ordered when I am there.  Another favorite is the silver spoon.  
Their take out is always busy, so if you are going for dinner, check to see if they will take reservations.  I know they take them for parties greater than 6. ||| Great restaurant! It was my first time here and I was not disappointed. I usually don't order apps when I get sushi, but a combination of my immense hunger and the delicious description led me to order the chicken yakitori, and I have been craving it ever since! The sushi tasted incredibly fresh, and the service was great. Only thing I would like to see improved is wait time, but even then I would say that the food was worth it! The prices weren't expensive and the location is very convenient and well lit/ decorated, as opposed to others in the area that tend to have a much darker color scheme. This will now be my go-to spot! ||| Excellent food with great presentation. Highly recommend this place if you're in the huntington valley area. The food is reasonably priced and they also have great customer service. ||| Wow! This is really a gem . This place is relatively new and the sushi here is just amazing. Very welcoming environment and in Huntingdon Valley what a rare find. I highly recommend. ||| Stopped by Sushiman up the street from my place for some dinner and this is the second time I've been here and the place was good! Besides being up the street from my house the thing I like about Sushiman is the huge menu you literally could try everything on it and still not have tried everything if you came here everyday. They have a huge variety of different types and combinations of sushi but also lots of other dishes as well such as appetizers and entree meals. I ended up getting the tonkatsu as well as my wife with fried oyster appetizers and a few pieces of sushi. The service was good and the food was yummy. The owners seem real nice and the place was packed. We also ended up getting the desert which were the green tea tiramisu and tempura cheesecake. I really enjoyed the dinner and plan to come more times because of the food and service. If you want some decent Japanese style food or some sushi, Sushiman is the place to come to. ||| Really great variety of sushi, entrees, desserts, and made to order selections. Everything tasted really fresh. Our favorites were the peppered steak, raw tuna, seafood delight, Dragon roll, and strawberry ice cream. The service was friendly and fast. We'll definitely be back! ||| Pleasantly surprised with this place (in an old Beige and Beige restaurant location). So many sushi places around, they all start running into each other in my mind. I liked that Sushiman had variety and dishes were a little bit different from your typical sushi restaurant. 
For example, the spicy tuna pizza was crunchy on the bottom and nice and fresh on top, with real slices of tuna as opposed to leftover tuna mush that most sushi places use. Presentation was also excellent. 
The 50% off menu really offers up some great pricing on fancy rolls. Portions are very decent size. 
They also accommodated some unusual request from my friend and I - bonus points in my book!

The decor is begs to be upgraded (for example old sticky carpets need to go!). But that doesn't bother me much so I will be most definitely coming back to try more. ||| The sushi is very good, but the service is painfully slow! Our first experience was on a weekend. We didn't have to wait for a table and the tables were about 75% occupied. It was 15 minutes before the waitress took our order and she only took our appetizer order at that time. We flagged her down 10 minutes later and gave her our dinner order. The first of three appetizers arrived about an hour after that. All-all, we were there for over two hours. Again, the sushi was good. This could have been a five-star review if the service was at least average. Our second visit was on a week night. The tables were under 50% occupied and service was still slower than one would expect. We're on the fence about whether or not to go back. This is a BYOB and they do take credit cards and reservations. ||| I know so many people that love sushiman so I had to give it 4 stars.  For me it's closer to 3 but I trust my close friends judgements so much that I was forced to give it a 4.  

The sushi sandwiches there.  This my friends and I completely agree on.  They are delicious.  The spicy tuna sandwich is great.  I've had unagi and yellowtail sandwiches there before very good. 

I'm not a fan of the other rolls here. But I think I'm also a different breed.  Sushi is my favorite food by far. And I am really really into the freshness, quality, texture of the fish. When I love a sushi roll  I can easily have it with no sauce.  I do really like to put wasabi on my sushi.     (I do lightly damp it sometimes in soy sauce) (use more soy sauce when the quality of the fish is mediocre) 

In sushiman, I find their fish to be mediocre. I've been to sushiman about 20 times so I have some  fairly good experience. (My friends love it) 

My friends love: 

Kani salad (sauce on the side)
Wasabi roll 
Sunshine roll 
Spicy tuna sandwich 
OMG sashimi roll
Chef roll

In conclusion, check out the place! It's a fun Saturday night out ||| Excellent sushi quick and friendly service too!

Had the magic and mango roll, both fresh and yummy!

Highly recommended! ||| Looked up yelp for a quick lunch spot nearby and found this gem. This place is pretty casual, unlike Ooka. My expectation was low, as for any sushi place outside the city. However, this place was a complete surprise for me. Yellowfin tuna was good, didn't look like they were trying to get away with using lower grade substitute like most places do. Sushi was made perfectly. Sashimi was cut just right, it wasn't sloppy or too thin. Portion for my chirashi was generous. And sushi and sashimi are half price! Service was good also.
I will definitely come back. ||| I've been here now a couple of times and I really like it. Dare I say my new favorite sushi joint in the neighborhood. The food is very fresh and they have quite a selection of specialty rolls, including the monkey roll, which has tempura banana on top and is terrific! I have been on somewhat of a nigiri kick lately, so I have been heavy into the maguro and hamachi. Both are excellent here. The miso soup is also very good, although I wish the chunks of tofu were a little larger. The broth though is very tasty.
The service is very good. I believe it is a family run establishment and they do have the right idea about attentiveness. It is very light and clean inside as well, as decorated very pleasantly. It's also BYOB. ||| I just found out about this hidden gem 5 minutes from my house. So as a huge sushi fan, I had to order a couple of rolls to try. I was not disappointed. Lots of flavor and color in the rolls. Everything tasted delicious and it became a once a week trip for me to this place. 
The Godzilla Roll is a must try. ||| Probably one of my favorite spots to grab sushi now around northeast philly! This place is right behind Murray ave middle school in huntingdon Valley. I ordered takeout sushi lunch special for $10 and it came with pieces of sushi and California roll and also salad and miso soup on the side. And I also placed another order in of chicken tempura roll on the side. The sushi was super fresh and really good. Place is kinda hidden but you can see their sign up front and there's parking in the back of the place. The entrance is also in the back as well. Inside looks very nice and clean. I will definitely be coming back here for more sushi. ||| Great sushi, generous portions. They don't overwhelm you with rice and actually give you sushi. Grab lunch here all the time ||| Ever since my family first ate at Sushiman last Christmas Day (such is the Jewish Christmas tradition; go to the movies and have Chinese food or sushi--in our case, we usually go for sushi), this is the place where we most often eat for family birthdays, Mother's Day/Father's Day, and other occasions.  Service is friendly and worth the wait because the restaurant tends to fill up especially on weekends.  My favorites are the New York roll (salmon and apple), the Shrimp Mango roll, the Sweet Potato Tempura roll, and the Hawaiian roll.  It took a bit of time for them to get things running efficiently when they first opened; being that on one of our first visits, a new Hibachi chef started on a busy Saturday evening and was still getting acclimated, but we gave Sushiman the benefit of the doubt and will keep eating there as long as they are on Huntingdon Pike! ||| Nice BYOB sushi restaurant in huntingdon valley. My husband and I tried different rolls and they were all delicious! If you like a quiet atmosphere, this restaurant is for you. I also recommend the tuna tartar. ||| Great new restaurant in the Valley! 
We have watched many restaurants open & close in this spot. I'd say this 1 is a winner - hopefully here to stay. 
Large menu selection. Everything we had was great. From sushi to desserts. Service was wonderful. Nice interior. I'd recommend this place ! BYOB ||| I  came here for Mother's Day and everything we ordered was delicious and fresh.  The restaurant was super clean and friendly.

I also order takeout at least once or twice a week and never had a negative experience. ||| Good sushi, excellent prices. Fish is fresh, smells good. Modern decor. For the cost this is an excellent sushi place. I would highly recommend this place over other sushi places in the area. Parking available in the rear. ||| Best takeout sushi in the HV & Somerton area. Prices are similar to the other sushi restaurants on Bustleton but the quality is better. 

Their variety of fish is better than the other places as well! ||| The best sushi place around. It is always fresh and quick. The wait staff is very polite and friendly. The restaurant is also decent size and clean. Always has people dining in. Their veggie dumplings are delicious. I come in here every week almost. It beats any sushi place around by far. ||| Good sushi for the prices and location is nice. ||| Sushiman for takeout is the way to go on a cold day! The chicken pad Thai was tasty - but there could have been more chicken. I've tried the lunch sushi specials (which end at 3 pm by the way) before and I reeeeally liked the spicy crab! Today I chose the Alaskan roll and Godzilla roll. Both were pretty good! Godzilla could have been spicier! Sushiman definitely has great prices! Will be back! ||| Started ordering take out from Sushiman about 6 months ago. Now we order at least 1x/ a week. Great quality, great price. The young man who runs the take out/front of the house does a great job! Especially on the weekends when they have a lot of orders! Looking forward to dining in once they open back up. ||| Amazing sushi experience two thumbs up thanks for a wonderful and delicious time my hat go off to the chef ||| Good choice for a sushi & Kamachi Hama but not for Branzino fish. I ordered whole Branzino that should come with soup, salad & rice. Another person at the table agreed to eat miso soup that comes with my dish & I proceed ordering Tom Yum soup. So, soup didn't come until everybody else eat their soup & salad & I had to remind the staff to bring my soup. It wasn't bad, had a nice flavor but it's not Tom Yum soup. That's not the end of the saga. Everybody got their main entries & I  was still waiting for mine. Yes, you got that - I remind the staff about my fish. Forget about salad that had to come also. Where is my fish? LOL. Trust me I regret every bit asking for it. That fish was cooked to death, it was charcoal. Staff is trying to be nice but needs to get their game together. To many people come to the table & that's why they get so many mistakes. ||| Wow what a great recommendation this was. The food here is incredible! 

Pros
-Lots of available off street parking behind the restaurant. Front and rear entrances. 
- Extremely polite wait staff as has always been our experience in Japanese restaurants. 
- Immediate seating on a Saturday night. 
- Clean, comfortable booths (and tables)
- Manager presence inquiring about how everything was and introducing herself and asking our names (Penny was so very welcoming).
-BYOB
- Unbelievably reasonable pricing given the quality of the sushi and sashimi.

Con 
- High ceilings in this beautiful building make for a very noisy atmosphere :(

Only 10 minutes outside NE Philly, this Japanese restaurant was easy to find and so worth the drive even if coming from further away. If you love sushi you definitely need to bookmark this one and make plans to try it. 

Of course I'm always too busy getting down to eat to remember to take pictures so the pic I do have isn't our complete meals.

I had the spicy tuna crunchy roll and the Diamond roll. The spicy tuna crunchy is not fried whereas the crunchy spicy tuna roll is so it's important to really look the menu over completely. 

All the sushi prices in their regular menu are 50% off so my spicy tuna crunch roll was only $3.50!  They also include a daily specials type menu for different specialty rolls. The spicy tuna roll actually had some kick to it, that spicy that's always missing from the spicy tuna! The Diamond roll had chunk tuna and avocado inside with spicy tuna and 3 different caviar on top. The Diamond roll melted in my mouth. It was so delicious. I've never had sushi up here in the northeast so fresh and tender that it melts in your mouth. 

Hubs had the spicy girl and the sapporo rolls. I definitely am ordering the sapporo roll for myself next time!

We both ordered seaweed salads for appetizer and in all 3 specialty rolls and one regular roll and our total was only $43!! We usually spend twice that at To-Kai and until now To-Kai has had the best sushi in the NE area. We now have a new favorite sushi spot. 

*They also do not charge a corkage fee to open your wine. ||| So happy that such a lovely sushi place has opened up so close by! The sushi was fresh everything was tasty. Hope to see more people checking this place out soon! A few kinks with servers and wait time, but those will be worked out shortly. Their early 50% off discount isn't hurting either. Def check it out before heading to school if you still can :-) ||| Great place with a wide variety. Sushi and the Sashimi were fresh tasting. Will definitely be back!!! ||| This is my favorite sushi place. We have been here multiple times with great service and good, cheap sushi. ||| Always decent sushi.  We get their party platters often when we go to friends houses and have to bring something. ||| My family has eaten here almost weekly since it opened. Fresh fish and creative rolls. Ten times better than some of the other discount sushi places on Bustleton. The staff works very hard consistently. Everyone in Huntingdon Valley needs to try it. You will swear off the love of all things Ooka. Just saying. ||| DELICIOUS!!! We had the rainbow sashimi roll and OMG sashimi roll (made w soy paper, no rice), and the red lion roll, caterpillar roll, and spicy tuna crunchy roll all made w purple rice. Everything was fresh and had great flavors. Restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. Can't wait to come back! ||| REALLY REALLY good! Finding a decent sushi place in suburban Philly / Bucks has been daunting for our California tastebuds. Fresh creative and yeah reasonably priced (which is usually a sign of bad sushi). Of course they don't deliver (the best ones never do) but it's worth the drive. Miso soup was great and the chicken Katsu was really good. Will definitely be back. ||| I've been getting takeout from here for the past 2 months, and every single item I've ordered tasted fresh and delicious.

Some of the favorite items i get are:
-Shrimp Tempura dinner - crispy and crunchy, comes with soup and salad.  The miso soup here is very good and has a lot of flavor.
-Kani su salad - I haven't seen this in many places and it's delicious. It's kani mixed in a sweet and sour vinegar sauce. I love it.
-UFO roll - fried kani in a spicy sauce
-Magic roll - shrimp tempura roll w/ tobiko and crunch.

If they keep the quality up every single time, I think this place will be my go-to sushi spot. ||| So glad we found this spot a few months ago after our go-to place on the Fairway closed that location. Everything from here is good, the pan friend noodles are an amazing meal for picky kids who won't eat sushi, and the quality, price & service cannot be beat. ||| I was not very excited to drive to Huntington Valley for sushi but my Mother really loved this place so I went for her. I'm glad that I did! The menu was extensive and had many options including pad thai which I love! This place takes part in the 50% off Sushi trend that has hit Bensalem and surrounding areas. I'm not sure why they discount but it's common and the food is still high quality so I'll take my discount with a smile! I saw beautiful sashimi bowls served but my family is more of a rolled sushi kind of group so that's what we went with. Most rolls were $3.50-$8.00 which is a bargain!

We had the Hawaiian roll. It was tempura shrimp covered with a large piece of mango. It was very sweet but a nice break from the rest. I also like that they make their Philadelphia rolls with cucumber instead of avocado. I don't know why but most places around me don't use cucumber and I prefer it! The beef pad Thai had very little beef but was delicious and a large portion perfect for sharing for only $11. 

My niece loved that the had Japanese soda. I didn't love that they use cans of soda for Coke products as I prefer fountain soda and could have used a refill because the kani salad we got was spicer then expected. My niece also said the ginger salad dressing had a kick which isn't something typical to be spicy. 

I'd definitely go back and recommend ...even if it's a bit of a drive. ||| We usually order for pick up. Our order is always correct,the food is always delicious. A great restaurant with a large selection of dishes. ||| What can I say.......top notch!  A hidden gem tucked inside Huntingdon Valley!

I went in for takeout, and almost went back for seconds to dine in, the atmosphere is that good.  

This is my first review on Yelp by the way, so compliments to the chef! ||| This was my first time at Sushiman and it was absolutely wonderful. Sushi was delicious, service was timely and friendly. Highly recommend the Hawaiian Roll, Huntingdon Roll and the Galaxy Roll. I will definitely be returning to Sushiman in the near future. ||| My wife and I had both heard good reviews of sushiman and wanted to check it out for ourselves.  Our first meal here was excellent.  

I wanted to make sure it was not a ""one hit wonder"" and waited to post a review.  We have now both eaten in and taken out a nubmer of times and I have to say the quality of the food was the same each time.  

Delicious.  

It is very good sushi place with some interesting choices. ||| Ordered takeout from here and did not leave disappointed. The prices are right and the food is really well packaged with great presentation. Taste is great, though I've definitely had better quality at a higher price point. Tuna pizza appetizer was delicious but thought it should have been bigger. Kani salad was a bit bland, will ask them to add spice next time. Will order from here again. ||| Very easy to ignore this small 50% off sushi restaurant but please don't. I am telling you, ditch Kyoto, ditch Ninja, Ditch Sushi X, come to this place as they do fairly priced sushi the right way. Very nice sized rolls and amazing quality/ flavor. Do yourself a favor and try Sushiman! ||| This location is hands down THE BEST out of all the Sushiman's. The teriyaki chicken was grilled & delicious! The sashimi rolls are AMAZING! I love that they are riceless rolls. Fast service. Great people working here. ||| Best sushi around - miso soup is definitely the best I've ever had. Great prices and the people are so nice. Love coming here for lunch! ||| We heard so much ravings. I was looking forward to eating here. We're huge sushi eaters. Wanted to try a new place. 
Everything was okay, however 3hrs later and I still cant get rid of the after taste of the Boston Roll! The shrimp seemed spoiled, maybe unwashed properly. Its such a simple roll, and its just cocktail shrimp. That ruined my experience. 
The bill was bogus also. Def over paid. We have eaten at upscale Japanese places and had more in quantity and quantity and paid less.  we will not be returning or recommending.",101,49,183598,15.81
78624,"Great food! My favorite is probably the butterfly shrimp with bacon or the lemon chicken! Absolutely fantastic! I definitely recommend! ||| This is the only Chinese place I will order from in spring hill. The food is delicious the owners and their children work so hard to keep everything consistent and they succeed. I recommend the Singapore may fun it's spicy and it will feed one person for 2 meals or more. ||| Great food! Always Fresh. Moved here a few months ago, and we were looking for a Chinese Restaurant!! Love the fact that they started delivering! Friendly Staff! The low Mein Combo! Is always ready to be devoured! Highly Recommend if you have a few minutes to eat or have it Delivered!! ||| Setting expectations, this is solidly good. I have had better, but not around here so far. I love Chinese take out, and have tried several in and around the area.  This one is the best so far to my taste. I usually have the Fried Won Tons, Chicken fried rice, and Sesame Chicken.  I have always had a good experience with the staff as well. ||| Amazing.  I have been order from them for almost 10 years.   Family owned business.   Great food.   Wonderful service.   One of my favorite places.   Worth the drive. ||| Just ordered from here, Still haven't found a Chinese restaurant I like, Had egg pork foo young , It was ok, nothing special, Did not like the egg roll , nothing special, just a lot of cabbage, This is my 10th Chinese restaurant that I have tried with in 8 miles of my house, I guess the search still goes on. Wish I could find a Chinese restaurant that the food wasn't so greasy ||| The general Tao chicken was very bland and not spicy at all. The beef fried rice was typical, nothing to write home about, a little chewy. It's a good go to if your first option isn't available. I think they use MSG though so be sure to ask about that when you order. I forgot. ||| Been going here for years and great food every time! Consistent and good ingredients. Everyone is friendly and helpful when we try something different too :) ||| Very disappointed. Wasn't pleased with any of the food. Seen other views online and we decided to take a chance. Won't be back. ||| Nope.... 
Ordered the Mongolian chicken.  The chicken was rubbery and over cooked. Barely sauced at all.
I'm not sure what part of Mongolia they are basing their flavors on, but definitely NOT like anything that I've ever had.  Funky, is what it was, at best.  The chicken fried rice was horrible.   They used blanched, unflavored, unfried chicken and added it to very dry fried rice.  I threw it out...
 The crab rangoon was more of a sweet wonton filling with crab and scallions.   The fried dumplings were ok.  The egg rolls tasted ""burnt"". 
 I read the reviews and decided to try it.  
No flavor and tasteless is how I would describe it at best. 
$36 down  the drain. 
Not a fan....
Won't order from here again.

On a positive note, the staff was very nice and all of the food was hot. ||| Ordered beer, got chicken. No napkins or eating utensils included. Food was medeocre. ||| We found China 1 when we were stressing over our move from Miami to Spring Hill. Love this spot. Reminds me of our go to Chinese food spot in Miami. This is our go to. So much that they even know our order by heart . ||| Absolutely the best Chinese food in Spring Hill. I've tried almost every Chinese restaurant on the west sode, and the have all fell short to China 1. It's an oxymoron to say New York style Chinese food, but that's the only other place that has consistent Chinese Take Out.   China 1 is the closest it gets for me. ||| Worse food ever, $25.00 in the trash after  two bites. If there was any redeeming value it was hot when we got it home.
Never again, the reviews I read recommended this place.
Not sure where those people are use to eating.
Not even the fortune cookies, they were stale ||| This is my favorite Chinese Restaurant that is not a buffet!!! I have had lunch here a few times. They always serve you on ceramic plates and give you noodles to munch on and the prices are great!!! I had dinner tonight of Shrimp Lo Mein. It was superb with nice sized shrimp. I had a shrimp roll and some Chinese Tea after dinner. You can see the pictures I posted. This is a nice cozy place. They do a huge take out business as well. ||| Good food! Their chicken and brocolli and lo mein are amazing. Worth a try if you're on this side of town. Everything always tastes fresh and delicious! ||| Had the Jade Scallops.
I was surprised that they were Ocean Scallop, very large.
They were prepared perfectly,very tender.",17,83,76659,1.56
171258,"Simply put.. Food is delicious and authentic tasting with a nice variety of tamales as well as taco, nachos.  However, the process of ordering might be the worst I've ever seen. Order from one register.. step to register 3 ft away and pay.. 3 ft away again to the pick up area. With a decent crowd you will be bumping into each other and probably get orders mixed up. Aside from that great spot. Hope they can tweak some organizalional bugs and stick around. ||| So thrilled that they are open in Greenwood. My hubs and I went on a Saturday night.  Fast service and the chicken chipotle nachos were the best!!  Cheesy, a perfect amount of heat, and the small order was more than enough for one person.  The salsa had so many flavors in it.  Totally different than any other kind of salsa I have ever had.  Can't wait to go back and try other items off their menu.  I'm going to be dreaming about this meal for a long time! ||| Late on a Friday the selection of tamales was limited. They have spicy and mild, so I asked how spicy is the spicy? She says, ""It's pretty spicy."" Which is a little vague and i'm trying to decide if she looks like a spicy food eater. What's a spicy food eater look like? How can you know? How can you be sure it's spicy enough until you've had too much? So, yeah, I ordered the spicy and you know what? It's not crazy spicy, but it's pretty spicy. 

I got the (mild) Beef Poblano Chile & Cheese Tamale, Spicy Chipotle Beef, and Chocolate. I'm going to say most people could not eat three tamales - masa is filling. The beef poblano and cheese had a great flavor. The cheese was queso fresco or something very mild and tasty with shredded beef and mild poblanos. The chipotle beef was pretty spicy and very tasty! 

The chocolate was VERY chocolatey. It's the weirdest damn thing, chocolate flavored masa?!? Who thought this was a good idea? Yet somehow ... it works!

The acoustics are rough. It was full on a Friday night and I had trouble hearing the gal taking my order when she asked questions. i'm not a fan of styrofoam, but like Yats ... I'll look past foam for food this good. Order at the counter and they call your name. ||| The tamales were delicious and the steak tacos are some of the best around here. We had the Beef tamales in red sauce and they were great. Authentically made and served. The atmosphere is cool, with tables and benches to sit on with a few smaller tables to sit at. Most people eat and run since this isn't fine dining at its best, but delicious finger food for eating on the go. We will be back. ||| I can't say enough about this place. Just make sure you get there early because it's first come first serve and the good ones go fast. But honestly they are all good so no worries. Now everyone knows they have world-changing tamales but I gotta give the tacos some love!  Seriously so good. ||| Not What I expected. They still have not worked out the customer service issues that is the most important thing. It's obvious that the same girls at the Rockville Road location must have trained the new folks. What a shame. I have been a customer of this restaurant since the very first on Rockville Road. Watching from the beginning to what they are now and unfortunately no good change. I keep hoping to go in get the same taste And smiling face from before. Although I will be back I am very dissatisfied with the service that I have received the last couple years. ||| I love the Tamale Place.  Their food is fresh and delicious and the tacos, tortas, and nachos are made to order.  I've had a torta, a few tacos, and several tamales here and they have not disappointed.  I love the beef in red sauce tamale and the steak and egg torta and taco. The peppers are pretty spicy, even the mild ones.  I could eat here everyday if possible. ||| I had the fish tacos and they were delicious. A different ordering experience than most people are used to, but the minor hassle and lines are definitely worth it. Will be coming back. ||| Ugh. Went in expecting more. Horrible ordering process, completely unorganized and confusing. Then we waited forever for our food only to find the lady leaning on the counter was too busy talking to other employees about her day than to just hand us our food that had been sitting there. After all that, it really doesnt matter what the food is like. We will not be going back. Don't like spending my money to have that type of bad customer service. Just be friendly, take my order and money and give me the food. ||| Good golly, Tamale--We've got quite a gem here in Indy!

Thank goodness for the service, because for a restaurant called ""The Tamale Place"", they offer SO MUCH that it was hard to decide, so the staff was very patient, offered suggestions, and explained everything quite well. I mean tacos, tortas, nachos and then tamales? 

One thing that was intimidating about this place is that I always hear that they run out of tamales... so they have a board of how many of each tamale they have left.. understandable.. but glad I tried their other stuff!!

So we had the fish tacos (yum), the chorizo egg taco (tasty), the pork in green chile tamale (a bit too much masa for me) but with the spicy salsa--it was a lot better.... my brother had the recession pork tamale in red sauce (smaller portion, my favorite tamale, I definitely like the flavor more)...

But the ultimate winner of the visit was there.. (drumroll please)....

NACHOS! Seriously, every chip packed a monster punch of queso, lettuce, and your choice of protein (we chose the chicken verde, I believe?) and it also normally comes with a heap of black beans, but we opted out... But oh my goodness. For $9, the large portion of nachos were shared among 4 people, SO DELICIOUS.

So glad they're local, and they're popping up all over town. A little weird that they loop the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives (just because I'm not the hugest fan of Guy Fieri..) but it lets you see how everything is made there! ||| Food is def 4.5 stars but the layout of the restaurant is more like 3 stars. Been here twice. First time was on a Friday during lunchtime. Pretty busy and organization was pretty bad. Second time was on a Sunday at lunchtime, less busy. They have 2 registers where you place your order and then you shimmy a few steps to the third register where you pay at. Think about it... 2 taking orders, 1 taking payment, equals cluster-mess. Shimmy again and your at the pick up window but your food is made fresh so you basically bump into the others who are either waiting for their food or trying to get to the fountain station. 
The other thing I didn't like was that they have these huge picnic tables probably 6 total and a long, skinny bar up against a wall. Just kind of weird to me. You either take up an entire picnic for only a couple of people,  eat facing a wall with little room, or ask if you can join a table of strangers. 
Last thing I didn't like was the trash cans. There are 3 large silver trash cans with lids. It grossed me out to have to lift the trash lid. Wish it was a basic throw it in the hole type trash. Much more sanitary in my eyes. 
Bathrooms are basic. Clean for the most part. 
But the food... Food is really really good. I've gotten their chicken tamale with red sauce, chicken taco, and steak taco. The tortilla chips are really good. Salsa is really good... Choice of mild or hot. The rice was also good. Not dry, but moist and flavorful. The nachos looked awesome.... I'll def be getting those next time. I don't think you could go wrong with your food choice here. 
I really hope that everyone helps to support this authentic restaurant. Definitely need more restaurants like this on the south side. ||| I've been waiting for months to try The Tamale Place and while I wasn't entirely disappointed, I'm thinking perhaps I shouldn't have gone on their grand opening day.
For the price, one expects darn near perfection and they seem to have missed the mark. 

My steak torta was soggy, had little flavor beyond the pico de gallo and the meat was so tough and gristly, I picked it out of the sandwich to take home as doggy treats.  My son's tamales (1 chicken, 1 pork), however, were authentic in flavor, the meat was tender and delicious, and the spice level was perfect.  The only thing I would change is the thickness of the masa which was just a little to thick and doughy.

I'll definitely go back because there are plenty of other things on the menu I'd like to try but I think I'll wait till they've worked out the kinks of being newly opened. ||| They don't have everything everyday, look at the giant TV when you come in to see what's still available. ||| I was super excited and maybe that was the problem. I love tamales but these were not good. Dense and dry. The one good thing was they had a higher meat to masa ratio than I am used to (meat is good!). But, texture of the tamales I got was awful. Also the order/pickup person was very unorganized and unsure of what I had ordered and what she was giving me. I will give it another shot when I'm in the area. First time was a tamale fail. ||| Tamales were excellent. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  This place will make the tough location work. We will be back. ||| Came in to see what all the hype was about and it def lived up to it! Got a Chipotle Chicken tamale and a Spicy Black Bean tamale, both spicy and delicious! The Chipotle Chicken is NOT for the faint of heart! Also shared a large order of the Chipotle Chicken nachos with my wife and we both loved it. Finished it all off with an Apple Pecan tamale and it was tasty too. Everything was just fresh and good and we are def coming back! ||| Tried it. Didn't love it. Not sure what all the hype is about. Too much masa, not enough pork on the tamales (they ran out of chicken), and generally no seasoning/taste. Salsa tasted weird. Won't be back. We prefer Roscoe's Tacos or Qdoba (granted, no tamales at either of those places). ||| Not what I expected from a place that just opened Not spacious not friendly things that are a must. The food was just ok. I hope things get better. I will try it again but as of right now I am not a fan. ||| I may be the voice of descent here, but I wasn't a fan... I mean. The tamales were good enough, but they didn't seem super flavorful. I got three different kinds, beef with red sauce, pork with green sauce, and chicken with green sauce. My favorite was the pork. I will probably give them another shot, just to try out some more flavors. The elotes was pretty good. I got the 8 ounce cup, which was a pretty large serving. Enough to share, in my opinion. It's removed from the cob, covered in sauce, and sprinkled with cheese. Next time I'd add a bit of lime juice to brighten it a little.

My husband and I got take away for lunch, and our order came to about 30 dollars, which was a little bit more than we planned on. Their ""inventory"" system, which shows how many of each kind of tamale they have available, is kinda spiffy, but they were definitely still working out the kinks as far as their operation goes.

As I said, well give them another shot, but I think it's possible that there was just a bit too much hype. ||| I had the basic chicken tamale. Very good. I used to work with a group of Hispanic women who would bring in homemade tamales. I was worried thus place wouldn't measure up. Great place and I'll definitely be  returning. ||| Having been to the west side locale I was happy to see the south side open.  Dinner time sat evening found friendly staff with quick service. 
I love the hot and spicy pork it's delicious but you must like things with some heat.  The chips are authentic to Mexico and I LOVE the elotes which I had on the street in Mexico. 
I must admit that I'm not a fan of their version of salsa ( to puréed for my liking). 
Food is very tasty but it's not necessarily inexpensive. It's worth it- it's locally owned and it's a great change of pace and flavor. The south side doesn't serve beer :( yet. Hope they do in the future. Mexico has many fantastic choices of beer. ||| Horrible!  I've been to the west side original location several times and it's great!  This was my first and LAST visit here!  To start, the cashier was pushy and annoying and they were not busy.  So I ordered the poblano cheese tamale and chips and salsa.  (My usual). This tamale is so hard and nasty!  The cheese squeaks when I chew it!  And the poblano tastes like canned spinach!  Now the chips... They are so greasy and when I opened the bag the smell of a filthy greasy pub hit me in the face. The oil they used needed changed weeks ago. They are covered in little brown dirty bits from the dirty oil. Total disgust. Waste of money!!  Oh and the salsa is bitter!  Every single thing is foul!  Do not waste your time sadly. ||| Food was flavorful and plenty. Would go back again an again if I didn't care to fit in my jeans.

Only complaint is the setup of the place. One line to order, another to pay, and another to pickup the food all pushed together so that customers are stepping all over each other. Not very much fun.

Again, the food great, layout, not so much. ||| Worse customer service ever. 11 people standing there and chatting and none of them could bring your food out or even call our name when the food was ready. You would expect more  from a place that charges 3.50 for one tamale!! ||| It looks like such a simple place - they make a handful of different tamales each day and when they're gone, they're gone. Problem is: they all sound so good. Another problem: they're all as good as they sound. 

Hubs and I popped in on a rainy mid-week lunch break, each grabbed 2 and left stuffed. 

If you're in the neighborhood, stop by and eenie-meenie-miney-mo the menu. ||| Just tried this new location. I'm glad to see that everything was familiar.  I like the setup more than the original location.  My friend ordered a medium container of queso, I think it was like $3.50. A little steep if you ask me. Bottom line is that this is a really good taco place. I'll be back. ||| I love this place! The steak tacos are yummy! The tortas are yummy. The tamales are yummy. Do you notice a theme here? The only thing I would change would be the seating/ dining area. They have picnic style tables and benches which aren't very comfortable and the other tables nod chairs look like patio furniture. They do however, have a really cool swing that is really nice to sit in after you've stuffed yourself silly! ||| First time here and I ordered chicken with green chile and spicy chicken chipotle. They were both terrific. Masa has great flavor. I'm Mexican so I was very judgmental at first but passed with flying colors not as delicious as my mommas but still tasty. Will be back to try nachos and tacos. ||| I love a good Tamale Place. I'd been dying to try the new location since I'm quite familiar with the original location. Food = same as always, 5-star AH-mazing chips & salsa & tortas & tamales. It's the usual ""order what you want until it's gone"" line up. So it appears the pricing per tamale has gone up a bit since my last visit. 

What kind of is unfortunate is the lack of seating, it's not as great as the [less-than-stellar] seating arrangements on Rockville Rd. Granted it's a small location, but picnic tables that take up a significant part of space are not ideal. ||| I don't care of the style of the restaurant.  You are expected an early lunch visit to get the first pick of better choices.  My boyfriend and I were checking out the menu, upon arrival, on the wall.  Then, we were told that they were out of a lot and to look at a different electronic menu on another wall.  This menu =  what was actually available and left over.

Not real helpful and it was only 4pm.  I felt like we were eating at a food truck, because the stock isn't the best (although the taste of them are usually good).

The Tamale Place isn't that tasty.  The flavor isn't the best.  Some components were incredibly dry in texture.

The interior isn't even practical with picnic tables ||| After visiting the west side location, my fiance and I were so excited to get The Tamale Place on the southside! 

We went into the store a few days after it was opened and the service was pretty slow. In their defense, they'd only been open a few days, so I'm sure they were getting used to being super busy and a new business, so I'm sure next time will be great!

As usual, the food was amazing! There's really not many negative things to say about this place other than it's small and most of the seating is picnic tables. Not the best for big groups, but great for lunch or dinner with a friend! ||| Seriously overrated. I stopped in for lunch, their ordering method is ridiculous and makes the customer easily confused and irritated. Not to mention, if you want to serve limited numbers of dishes and never insure that the customer is going to get what they're coming for, maybe you should open a food truck instead of a restaurant with several locations. 
I wanted the black bean tamales, but they ran out so I ordered a completely different option for lunch. As I'm waiting for my order, the board updates itself with bean tamales. Well, damn-that's what I wanted. So I go back and ask if they actually have them now from the two minutes ago I just ordered. Yes, we do. Would you like to place another order?  Idiot me, agreed to pay for another lunch order versus just canceling my previous order and regretted that decision completely. I wouldn't order either of the lunch dishes that I got ever again. ||| This place has great food. The best part is when your handicapped struggling with two kids and the 11 people behind the counter stare at you while your struggling to get your food to the table. ||| Quality of my food was on par with the Rockville Road location, which was impressive given that I visited on only their third day of operation on the Southside.

Those trying the Tamale Place for the first time should be advised that the tamales are made-from scratch and must be prepared far in advance; therefore, quantities are limited daily. The later one arrives, the more tamale selections are likely to be unavailable.",34,163,105296,103.44
139389,"My favorite Mexican restaurant! I use to go at least once a week and rarely had bad service.  The food is always great. ||| This is by far our favorite Mexican restaurant!  We've been to numerous others around town but stopped going to the others when we found this one.  The food has been wonderful every time! Definitely the best guac and the chicken in the chimichangas is cooked with onion and pepper and seasoned very nicely.  We've been very happy with everything we've tried, though to be fair, the chicken chimi is so good I get it most of the time.  If I were to have any negatives, it would be the desserts, but my son loves the one made with cheesecake.  But...I never really have room anyway!   Strawberry margaritas are wonderful!!  Hope u enjoy it as much as we do! ||| ...I'll preface this with the service was worth three stars; however, that is not enough for me to average this out any higher because, after all, many dining experiences with bad food just wipe away any of the good service parts of the meal.

The salsa - it was like canned, crushed tomatoes without (thankfully) the tinny tasted.  It was bland and uninspired.  If you would have thrown in some onion, cilantro, garlic, lime and salt - or even just one of those, it would have been a vast improvement.  Instead it was just this liquidy tomato stuff in a bowl.  If I would have had basil and oregano, I could have made a nice sauce for pasta.  Let's just say that set the tone.  I mean really, if you cannot get salsa right what else is going to be tasty?  I only had one chipful of the stuff and that was MORE than enough for me.

With it being lunch time, husband and I both ordered off of the lunch menu.  I decided on the fajita nachos because I was weary of more complex dishes after the failed salsa experiment.  I got mine mixed with both chicken and beef.  It looked good - lots of meat, plenty of sautéed peppers and onions but that was a mirage.  In actuality, what I wound up with was a wet mess.  Instead of a thicker queso or simply melted cheese, my nachos were swimming in some murky liquid that resembled cloudy chicken stock.  Not an appealing sight, eh?  Also, it was so blistering hot that I think it came straight from the microwave.  If I wanted to nuke something for lunch, I would have bought a Lean Cuisine.  I think I got through about three bites before I covered my plate with my napkin.  To be fair, the husband got the California Burrito and declared it okay....  Nothing more than okay though.

Sometimes I think Mexican places ""dummy down"" things and do not put much ""punch"" in it because the gringos will complain that it's too hot.  Well I'd like to see options.  I'm not a gringo.  I was born and raised in San Antonio.  I have a 92 year old Abuelita.  I know the difference between Tex Mex and Mexican.  But having bland food from any culture is uncalled for ||| Great specials. The food usually gets out to you pretty quickly. It's always consistent as well, which is nice. Love the waiter who always calls us ""my friends,"" every time he asks if we need anything. This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in the whole world. ||| The last couple times I have been to El Comel the service has been great.  The food quality and taste have been very good too.  We are fans. ||| Stopped in for a second visit today and had the combination dinner #15 (enchilada, burrito, & tamale) and my wife got the lunch meal with cheese enchilada with rice and beans. 

On our previous visit we both ordered house specials and were very happy with both house specials. The house specials were served temperature hot with a lot of flavor.

The combination dinner & lunch dinner was very bland, serve barely warm and the red sauce tastes just like canned spaghetti sauce from the grocery.

The staff was fast, professional, and very attentive. The store was clean with ample parking.

If you want the best meal there go with one of the house specials. ||| Great little mexican place. Love the food and generally good service. Been here many times, their casero is delicious. Get it and the cheese dip every time. Normally would do ala carte burritos and tacos over a main entree. 

The chicken nachos are good! ||| Definitely not the best Mexican restaurant in the area. I have eaten at nearly every Mexicano joint in the Hermitage/Mt. Juliet area. If you like frozen Mexican food and or heated up by the microwave, then this is the place for you.

The only reason I didn't give it one star, was because nothing came out with mold on it. And we didn't have any dirty silverware or plates.

It was just my wife and I, and our meal cost us about $35. For that same price, and a little further drive, we could've eaten in the Gulch at Cantina Laredo. It is by far one of the best Mexican food joints there are in Nashville. If you haven't eaten there I highly recommend it. Everything is fresh every day, in the presentation and service are amazing. ||| I'm from Southern California where you can find the best Mexican food. When i moved to nashville i was on the hunt for something that reminded me of home... This definitely is the best Mexican food ive had ever since i moved here & its less than 5 minutes from my house! My favorite is their tacos el pastor!!! Yum!! The price is very reasonable for how much food you get!!!! ||| We used to be regulars, but lately service, food, and overall atmosphere has declined significantly. All of the meat is either undercooked or burnt to a crisp and orders are often not correct. Servers have an attitude when you ask them to correct it. Would not recommend when there are multiple other fantastic Mexican Restaurants in the area. ||| This place is bad. The food was cold when I got it, the burrito I asked for only had meat.... no rice, beans, nothing. Meat wrapped in a tortilla. The chips were stale.... everything I received in my bag was so cold. I'm gonna pretend I lost 7 dollars because that was... sad to say the least. ||| I asked for a large margarita.  It was 90% ice.  It was $14.95.  In Mt Juliet TN.  At best 20oz of margarita.  Don't order a large margarita. ||| The staff was very nice and so were the pictures on the menu. The food came out fast. The salsa was wonderful and the best thing about the meal. The Peach Margarita was good. I ordered the taco salad. The shell was cold and stale. The beef in my taco salad didn't have much flavor. The food was average and it was a shame because I really liked the atmosphere but probably won't be back. ||| Ive been here before and its good prob give 4.3 stars. Last night we went again and got a combo fajita for 2 which is suposed to be steak and chicken but my wife does not eat beef. We asked to sub beef with chorizo and they were cool with it. It was so great and the portion size was fabulous as well. I was almost shocked at how great this was. My son finished his meal so I told him to try some of ours, his eyes lit up as soon as he put it in his mouth. 5 stars for sure on this dish and since im having it each time I go it 5 stars gor the resturant. Awsome! ||| Couple weeks ago. What can I say. This place never lets me down. I might forget what something is called but they got it handled. I ordered the Texan fajita and my mistake wasn't my normal so they fixed it right up. ||| Where do I begin? First it was very convenient to order for pick up online.. The staff was extremely friendly, and the restaurant immaculate. Then we had the food.  Salsa was fresh and had high quality ingredients, but tasted off. Actually it tasted like pasta sauce. I believe someone mixed the cilantro and Italian parsley up during shopping.. The guacamole again very fresh and high quality ingredients. The avocado was sooo smooth and creamy. It was a tragedy that the ridiculous amount of garlic ruined the flavor. No onion, peppers or lime juice...just garlic and avocado. When I say garlic I mean almost as much garlic as there was avocado.. The grilled chicken we had was very good but rice was a bit over salted.. The fried ice cream was the high point of our meal along with the fresh tortillas.  Both items were very good.  I'm not sure if the restaurant was having an off night, but I will have to try a few other nearby Mexican Restaurants before I even think about returning to this one. ||| The staff is friendly and the food is ok.  It is hard to find good salsa and the salsa here is just ok at best.  The service is quick and like I said the staff is the best part . ||| Fantastic food at great prices. You need to try this place out. ||| Thia is my favorite local Mexican restaurant and we have many to choose from.   Great margaritas and fajitas.  Service is always great.   We've gone here at least once a week for the past several years. ||| Great lunch specials. We go often after church on Sundays when the special is $6.98 for fajitas and a drink.  The portion is large and the food is high quality.  Plus, the guacamole casero is excellent.  Even my husband loves it, and he doesn't normally like guacamole. ||| Great service and prices. The food is a little to  bland tasting for me.  They need to add a little salt and spice to there food.  If you are new to the area I would recommend Cinco De Mayo over El Comal.  But I have have to say as for service El Comal is hard to beat. ||| We stopped by here while we were in the area on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant is located in a strip mall. The interior is your average Mexican restaurant. We were warmly greeted and sat at a booth. Our sever was a young woman who was friendly and helpful. We asked about the sizing of the guacamole. They've got a small guacamole for $3.99 and a large for $6.99. She said that the small was about 1/3 the size of the large. We decided on the large guacamole. 

The chips and salsa were pretty good. The chips were served hot, which I always enjoy. The salsa was more liquid than chunky. The guacamole was smooth, not chunky like I enjoy. I like some tomatoes, onions, cilantro in the guacamole, The serving was large for the price, however, I don't think I would order it again. 

I got the shrimp grande quesadilla for $12.99. It comes with pico, guacamole, sour cream and lettuce. The quesadilla was loaded with shrimp and cheese. I thought the shrimp could've had a little more seasoning on them. they looked pan seared on one side. My boyfriend got a mixture of different tacos, one of them pork and the pork was kind of dry and not very shredded. The pineapple one was good though, along with the chorizo, spicy. ||| Food was just ok. But the service was awful. Slow, never got refills on drinks, and took a good 15 minutes to even get things started when we sat down. Just avoid it. ||| Not bad at all...always friendly service and fast turn around. Food is always hot too...as it should be. Try the cheese dip..it's great! ||| I have been looking for good, authentic Mexican food since leaving California over 20 years ago. I have finally found it at El Comal (The Griddle)! This easy to miss restaurant has fabulous food that starts with the chips and salsa. They make their own chips and the salsa has a nice little kick to it. I tried the chopped beef chimichanga and it was wonderful. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of their menu, especially the differebt nachos offerings. I've found my new ""go to"" restaurant for Mexican food!! Comida maravillosa!! ||| Below average. Food was ordinary and uninspiring. Tasted like everything came out of a can or was otherwise on par with institutional kitchens. Definitely did not seem fresh but at least it was clean. They charged us for the two deserts we ordered but only delivered one. Doesn't matter - we won't be going back. ||| First time here and I will be back. 
It's clean, everyone is very friendly and there were buckets of flavor in my veggie chimichanga. 
The chunky guacamole could have been a meal in itself so I have plenty of leftovers to fill my next day(s) with El Comal sunshine. 
I was pleased as pickles. ||| August 2018: Been awhile. Love the fajitas and grilled jalapenos, eat as many as I can. Outstanding service.

December 2 2018: Never fails great food outstanding hospitality. Eating fajitas 30 years first time someone offered corn tortillas and it added to the already great flavor. Substituted the bell peppers for jalapenos. All around best. ||| This place never fails me. They are always welcoming and what ever I order I never fear whether it's going to be good. ||| August 2018: Been awhile. Love the fajitas and grilled jalapenos, eat as many as I can. Outstanding service. ||| This is our usual stop after church on Sunday's. They are always friendly and accommodate our group's seating needs. I really like the salsa here as it has a uniform/thick consistency that holds well to the chip. Their Sunday special Nachos Fajitas is a hit for the price (which includes a drink). I rate this place as one of the top 2 Mexican restaurants in the Mt. Juliet area. ||| The food here is just ok. Nothing special, salsa doesn't seem fresh made but canned. 

Pricing is fine for what you get. 

Patio is really just the front side walk. It's loud due to traffic buzzing by major intersection in Mount Juliet. 

The service was good for lunch time but they weren't very busy. ||| Great food, I have yet to try the liquor though! Last time I was here I got the chilaquiles which were to die for! The atmosphere here is that of any typical Mexican restaurant. The candy/gum at the counter are reasonably priced and they offer a wide variety.. ||| Some really good Guacamole. Better than average salsa and food. The grilled chicken was awesome,not dry,and had that good grill flavor. ||| I feel like El Comal took some ingredients that are relatable to Mexican food and without any guidance other than maybe some pictures, tried to approximate a Mexican food menu. Everything turned out soggy, drenched in oil and tasteless. Perhaps it would help to dial back the menu and focus on one or two things like the bean to lard ratio. Or, flavoring the chicken. The guacamole was fine, a safe bet if you're pressed to eat here. I have never in my life seen taquitos that look like theirs, and I have taught kindergartners to make taquitos. Just, very disappointing. ||| Wife and I have come a few times and we have had a good meal each time. I am still not a fan of most of the Mexican food in TN, as I am used to the Mexican I had from California, but when I am wanting it, this is the only place I have found that does justice to Mexican food, with a great taste, and good quality. I have had the rolled tacos, burritos, tamales, and enchiladas and I have liked them all. If I could have one thing, I would like it with carna asada instead of just ground beef. That's the one main difference I have seen that differentiates California style Mexican from TN style. ||| Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Mount Juliet.  The service is consistently good. Love the warm chips and tasty salsa. We ordered the steak fajitas for two. The amount of food was impressive. Good ratio of meat to veggies. The onions and peppers were cooked with a little crispness left. Not mushy. A couple tomatoes were tossed in too. The salad plate for the fajitas was nicely presented. I would have liked a little more pico. The guacamole was included without an up charge. Margaritas are tasty and a variety are offered. Drinks were promptly refilled. 
Outdoor seating is available, weather permitting. ||| This is our favorite Mexican place in Mount Juliet. It has a wide variety on the menu, and consistently good food and service. The molcajete special is one of our favorites! ||| I eat here at least once every two weeks because the mixed fajitas and cheese dip are so good. I have tried many other items on the menu and have yet to come across anything that I didn't like. The chips and salsa are tasty and to me, better than many of the other Mexican restaurants in town. The owner is nice and the staff are for the most part but are generally in a hurry in taking your order. They are very busy every weekend, yet it rarely ever affects getting seated in a timely manner. Overall, it's one of my favorite restaurants to frequent and would suggest it to anyone looking for some excellent Mexican food. ||| we visited this restaurant because it had a pretty good approval rating on urban spoon, and i really wanted to find a go-to mexican restaurant in mt juliet (our experience at hacienda del sol was horrible).  the manager was actually our server, and he was so friendly and helpful. i timidly asked if i could have a fried egg added to my enchiladas (timidly because at hacinda del sol i was shot down very quickly, because their egg dishes are only served until 4, and we were there at 5...). our server/the manager, cheerfully said that'd be no problem. the food was good, and the place was super clean. this'll probably be our go-to mexican restaurant in the mt juliet area. ||| Recently moved back to Tennessee and decided to try this place out after reading Yelp reviews.  The restaurant was fairly clean and well kept.  There is a nice porch area when the weather is not hot.  The prices are great especially the lunch menu.  I had fajitas and my wife had a steak quesadilla, all of which was good. The only reason I did not give this place 4 stars was due to the service.  Our server was extremely inattentive, and we had to stop other servers a couple of times to get what we needed.   Since this was our first time at the restaurant, will give the service a second chance especially after reading all the positive reviews from others. ||| Drink specials on fri and sat!  I have lived in this area for 3 yrs.  My husband and I LOVE Mexican food, and were regular patrons of another Mexican restaurant in the area.  We decided to yelp to find a better one, and we sure did with this one!  Thanks to the other reviews on yelp, we found our new favorite Mexican restaurant!  It is a small place, but overall, the quality of food, service and price are exceptional! ||| Normally this place is pretty good. However today not so much. The service was bad. No drink refils, one drink never brought to the table, had to ask for silverware twice. We ordered guacamole as an appetizer and it came after the entrees. The food tastes just ok. Maybe just a bad, isolated issue, but very disappointed from previous experiences here. ||| 3.5 stars, if it were possible on Yelp.

Dang, you'd think by all these five star reviews that this was the best Mexican food in Nashville and surrounding areas. Is it? No.  No better than the Cinco de Mayo a little further into Mt. Juliet, but it's Mexican fare and they have good food and drink specials. The place was very clean, salsa better than most (I like mine with lots of cilantro), but the service was lacking when I went on a busy Saturday night.

All in all, I would come again when I'm in Mt. Juliet, but don't go out of your way expecting the best Mexican food (sorry, previous reviewers). ||| I ordered enchiladas, rice and beans.. Nothing too exciting. It was good but I wouldn't say it was great. I just moved here from Oklahoma & I have to say, nothing around here compares. When we walked in, my husband and I stood there for about 5 minutes before we were seated and they were not very busy at all so I'm not sure why they were ignoring us. We also waited to get the check and finally decided to just go up to the register and ask for it. It wasn't horrible, but I will most likely not return. ||| El Comel is a nice little Mexican Restaurant. The service is always friendly and prompt and the food is good for the style and price of the place. The sitting area is always top notch in cleanliness, the restrooms are average cleanliness. They will make your chicken dish with Grilled or shredded Chicken. The regular house Margaritas have a good tequila taste and of course they will be glad to upgrade to top shelf upon request. ||| We've eaten here before several times and really enjoyed their food, but last week when we went everything was just really off.  The tortilla chips tasted really stale which was surprising, and the salsa had a really bad taste to it, it's normally a lot better than that.  It was a rare time where we didn't finish the salsa or chips provided.  

I didn't order anything crazy, just a chimichanga and a chile poblano to try it.  From their menu, it says:  ""Stuffed poblano pepper with chihuahua cheese, covered with egg whites and deep fried, topped with ranchero salsa.""

What I actually got was a flat poblano pepper with nothing in it, extremely soggy and covered in a weird red sauce.  I was hoping it would be similar to the chimichanga which is also fried, but it was so soggy and any breading just fell apart in the sauce which was not a salsa.  It looked awful and didn't taste good at all.  The chimichanga was fine, but the cheese sauce was really bland this time, they usually put green chiles in the cheese sauce and didn't.  

My girlfriend just got rice with cheese and onions, and didn't have any complaints about it, but it's hard to mess up rice, cheese and onions.  We were going to get dessert, but decided not to bother since the kitchen must have been having an off night.  

We would probably go back, but they really need to look at what their kitchen staff is cooking.  Their food used to be a lot better, and we don't need Mt Juliet to lose another Mexican restaurant. ||| As a transplanted Texan, I am always on the hunt for great, authentic Mexican food. We have eaten several different items from the menu and loved everything we ordered. There has also been enough food to need a to go box.  Last Saturday the parking lot was FULL but we had no wait and were seated immediately. ||| Used to be my favorite place until the following happened. Found a long hair mixed in with my food half way through it. My friend found one also. Nicely told the waitress and she said she would take care of it. She came back and informed me that no one in the kitchen has long hair ( she forgot that waitresses did). When going to pay, told manager he kinda blew me off and told me my total which was discounted by only $2 for it ( my half eaten dinner).Haven't been back since. I don't like not being believed when I find a hair in the middle of my food. Very poor customer service in this situation. Will take my business elsewhere. ||| I love El Comal, we use to only go to the Cinco's restaurants but now we only eat here. Fajitas are always sizzling, food is always hot, and the service is always good. Cold beer, a wide variety of food to choose from on the menu. ||| Get the Guacamole Casero to go and leave it at that.  It's the real deal.

I really wanted to like this place for take out in particular, they have the online ordering and it works.  After multiple orders I can say that I'm done with El Comal.  They use KETCHUP to replace tomatoes.  It's in their salsa and they used it as a base for Shrimp Diablo.  After I rinsed off the ketchup, the shrimps were very salty.  Carne Asada  = shoe leather ||| We did not care for the salsa. The rice was very bland. The place did not seem that clean. Floors inside unswept, flies kept bothering us. Overall just disappointed. ||| Came in on a Sunday night, glad they weren't take out only. Chips and salsa were plenty for our party of 6 once we sat down. The food was ok. I just wish the salsa burrito I got wasn't so close to it the enchilada. The flavors clashed a bit and everything became a bit soggy once I cut into it and the liquid leaked everywhere. Also, where we were eating there was air constantly blowing on our heads, making us want to rush out of here. All the food was plentiful, the beans and rice were the highlight for me here. I also, couldn't flag down our server to get a refill on my coke. Decent place. Might be back. ||| Ive been here before and its good prob give 4.3 stars. Last night we went again and got a combo fajita for 2 which is suposed to be steak and chicken but my wife does not eat beef. We asked to sub beef with chorizo and they were cool with it. It was so great and the portion size was fabulous as well. I was almost shocked at how great this was. My son finished his meal so I told him to try some of ours, his eyes lit up as soon as he put it in his mouth. 5 stars for sure on this dish and since im having it each time I go it 5 stars gor the resturant. Awsome! ||| Hadn't been inside for awhile due to this covid and I don't go in anywhere because of it but tonight I had to go inside and visit. The hospitality is the best around and the food is a plus, never disappointed to eat here. Lots of smiling eyes behind those mask ||| Still number 1.  Great food Great service and even during this pandemic they still shine. Call them up, place your order and then when ya get there give them a call and they will bring it out to you. I sure do miss sitting inside and shooting the breeze with them. ||| We have ordered from here before for lunch and today the food was cold and someone in the office ordered desert and they put the ice cream in the container with the hot food it was melted EVERWHERE... I called down to talk to them in hopes they would make it right and I was told ""I don't know what to tell you"" there was no, oh just come back down here and we will fix it... or I am sorry, just "" I don't know what to tell you"" ||| Gross, not good no flavor no spices, sorry horrible Mexican food, and 6 bucks for side of guacamole and sour cream. Glad we don't live here so we don't have the option to return ||| My favorite Mexican food in Mt Juliet for years! Always fresh, great selection, not just your typical Tex mex. ||| Well I see a lot of good reviews on this place but I see no reason. I go in for a to go order and order tortilla soup and a pastor burrito. I take it home ..... 5 min down the road. All the food is cold. The burrito was like a mix between sweet and sour pork with a little bit of spicy wrapped in a tortilla and covered with lettuce and sour cream and a sliced tomato. I have had pastor many times and never in my life has it tasted so horrible. It was also a tiny burrito as well. So I moved onto the soup hoping it to be a better pick. It was not in fact worse. Imagine boiled chicken in water with some rice. Zero flavor chips were stale and I added hot sauce and salt to it after trying it to help the flavor but nope can't fix boiled chicken and rice water. The only redeeming quality of the place is a cute blonde girl that works the front desk. Seems like she is aware of her surroundings and presentable. Still not enough to ever make me want to eat here again ||| We come here all the time with the family! So much so that they have watched my niece and nephew grow up. Service is always friendly and they get you in and out pretty quickly! The food is pretty standard Mexican, and while not great, it is better than most. They always have big, cold cervezas ready to roll! ||| Very bland flavors. It needs more spice (any spice will do). Waitress was more concerned about the other side of the room when taking our order. On a good note no cheese dip on anything we ordered. Guacamole was the best part. Soggy tostada. Beans were cold and dry. Enchilada sauce dry and cracked. Salsa could've been from a can - no flavor. I recommend you bring some jalapeños if you want any heat. ||| A solid Mexican eatery. Fajitas, burritos, nachos, chimichangas, and salads are all good. My kids favorite menu item is the cheeseburger and (sinful) fries. They have double dipped the fries n seasoning and the result is incredible! Give it a shot ||| We have tried pretty much every Mexican restaurant within a 30 mile radius of this one, and this is, by far, the best. Service is great, the restaurant is clean and cozy, and the quality of the food is top-notch even the chips and salsa they bring out is worth paying good money for!

If I could personally recommend a meal, it would have to be the Shrimp and Chorizo nachos. To die for! ||| Drive from Gladeville for their Mar Y Tierra fajitas, always fantastic along with the service which is excellent!!  Recommend Highly!! ||| AMAZING! I absolutely love this place. We live a few minutes away and we go here at least twice a week. The staff is super friendly and fun to talk to. They have memorized our order. Another thing we love is that they don't mind tweaking your order so it is just how you like it. Also, they have a punch card- after ten meals you get a free one! I absolutely recommend. ||| Great service (and quick!). Great food. Everything is seasoned and cooked really well. We enjoyed it and will definitely go back to eat, but we found the margaritas to be weak and mostly mix. ||| Not bad. Service was exceptionally quick. Server almost seemed in a hurry to take our orders, bring our drinks, and return with the food. Not a complaint, just funny. Dude looked like Taz on a rampage. The chips were good. Salsa decent, and cheese dip a bit runny, but it settled after a few minutes and firmed up nicely. The rice was Excellent. Well seasoned and prepared. Food was flavored well also. The drinks (margs) leave something to be desired. Very very weak, and over used mix. We will come again for food, but pass on the drinks. ||| This is our favorite restaurant in Mt. Juliet. The food is great. The service is great. We enjoy going here with our friends to eat. ||| Would not recommend take out here. Got home they had left out my Cheese Dip which we use on everything (cashier said she gave me a large). Chile Poblano was very greasy - could not eat it. Burrito was bad. Best part of meal was a tamale which was good. Wish it had been better but will not be back. ||| i have been here 3 times and every time I have been there the service sucks. The waitress ( twice we have had the same) rolled her eyes at us when my friend and I ordered a margarita. The hours states 10 pm closing. We arrived at 9:00. At 9:30 pm finishing up and we felt rushed and felt very unwelcome. The food and margarita's are pretty good but the service sucks!   I would rather go to Cinco de Mayo! ||| I'm here during cinco de mayo and they are killing it! We were seated right away, served chips and drinks before we even got settled and our order was out before we even got 1/4 way through the chips. Maggie made sure our drinks were always full and we always had what we needed. Also, because we were near the door we were able to observe and confirm that everyone else had the same wonderful experience we did! And there were a ton of people! After all it was cinco de mayo / Sunday lunch rush. The food was delicious and prices were fair as well! I've never seen a team come together with such excellence before like this one did. Good job! Your people really made the difference! ||| Great Mexican place.  
4/5 for service.  
5/5 speed
5/5 cleanliness
4/5 food
4/5 price ||| The service is still excellent and the food quality and taste have improved a lot over the past couple months I have gone. They have a huge menu with lots of taste options now. I moved my star rating up from 3 to 4. ||| Only have been here once so as bad as I want to give it a one star I will be fair and maybe give one more try.

The food and service was very poor and it was like pulling teeth trying to pay out just to leave.

The Chicken Tortilla Soup was awful ||| Really confused on all the good reviews. If we are being honest, this place doesn't deserve more than two stars. The only reason I didn't give them one star is bc the service was not awful. That's not to say it was good - just not terrible. The salsa tastes like marinara sauce and none of the food is seasoned. I've been here a few times and ordered a variety of dishes and nothing seems to even be salted. The best part was the cheese dip but the small comes in a tiny, shallow dish and you have to ration your dips or else it's gone in three scoops. Chile pobla-NO! Spare your wallet and don't even try it! Greasy, watered down trash. Sorry for the harsh words but this app is made to share with others and help them decide what's good and what's not. Go down the street a ways to Cinco de Mayo... great margs and salsa and prices. You're welcome",76,144,129369,11.009999999999998
172563,"Don't even bother coming here. The food is terrible and expensive. The restaurant is dirty and the way you pay inside and get your food outside is stupid. ||| Tacos just like Mexico. All they need is the crema. I got the carne asada tacos and the meat was delicious and the corn tortillas were great. Definitely fulfilled my craving for real Mexican tacos. Will definitely be back ||| Their carne asada is awesome! Totally takes me back to my trips to Rocky Point. Definitely will be going back! ||| I stumbled upon this place and my goodness it hits the marks for down home Mexican food. Ingredients are fresh and delicious I had the chicken burrito. Very filling. I also got a Macedonia ice cream which was awesome. I can't wait to come back. ||| The food is good, I've definitely had better tacos elsewhere. I think the $1 tacos should be for all tacos and not just chicken...$1.75 for a little steak taco is a little pricey. Would be nice if there was more seating too. Nothing ""wow""ed me here. ||| My food was $14. Then, when I got home saw that I had actually been charged $21.50. It was a square payment device and I'm sure the girl just gave herself a nice tip. Very upset to essentially have been stolen from. ||| This is one of my favorite hidden gems in Tucson. Their cabeza tacos are absolutely delicious (and I never liked cabeza until this place). They have amazing Sonoran hotdogs and caramelos. Not to mention they sell all sorts of Mexican antojitos like raspados, chamoyadas and all sorts of Mexican candy/treats. And I love that they have a fresh salsa bar with veggies and so many different salsas to pick from. If you like spicy, the orange one surely has habanero and lots of flavor. And for those that prefer flavor without the spice, there's plenty of others to pick from.  This place always hits the spot. ||| Passing through Tuscon and needed a taco . So glad we found this little stand. Order and pay inside (3 tables) pick up order at the food truck outside (more picnic tables there). Tacos $1.75 - carne asada or pollo asada. Nice little salsa bar with cucumber, radishes, pickled red onion, pico and sauces (avocado, lime, red and habanero). Burritoes, quesadillas, carmellos too. Some of the best we have eaten. Don't be put off by the outside. Friendly people and great food!!!! ||| Tried this truck today at my place of employment! I had the 3 tacos special, 1 chicken, 1 carne Asada, and 1 carnitas!
All three were plentiful meat wise, and all 3 were delicious!
The stand out was the Carnitas! This was slap yo mama good! So juicy and flavorful!
There were 3 salsas available by way of the salsa bar, along with cucumber slices, and halved radishes!
The salsas were just fresh and delicious!
I highly recommend this truck! It was very good!",9,252,77812,3.7
51420,"I was disappointed. I ordered the chili dumplings, dan dan noodles, and my boyfriend ordered the special, khao soi. While waiting for our food, I heard the waiter tell the next table over that they were out of fried zucchini and then they were also out of fried mushroom. These dishes were part of the specials menu. Looking at their menu, which they say changes from time to time, they also marked off two dishes to be unavailable.

While we waited, they gave us shrimp chips. Shrimp chips were good! They had a seafood taste to it. My dan dan noodles came first so I shared some with my boyfriend. Then the dumplings came, and the dumplings looked pretty sad. They were 5 for $7.95 for pork dumplings. See picture for size reference to a soup spoon. It comes down to $1.75 for one dumpling with a morsel of meat... Not worth it. You taste more of the wonton skin than the meat.

The dan dan noodles were okay. It was a little dry. The Chinese broccoli was over cooked and mushy.

The only redeeming plate was the khao soi, which had a great broth. It was kind of like pho, where they brought by Thai basil, jalapeño, and lime.

It seems they do tasting menus. I would be interested to see what kind of unique dishes they would bring out for a tasting event. There was a table celebrating a birthday and I noticed they got to try wagyu beef, which isn't on the menu. ||| The food was delicious! The special chicken thigh ramen was so flavorful & the pork dumplings with the miso garlic sauce was out of this world. Staff was so friendly & attentive ||| Ignore the suburbia strip mall location and run don't walk to Abandon Izakaya for an excellent meal.

Their concept is Asian/global street food, and execution is on point.  I had the spicy chicken ramen and it was some of the best ramen I've ever had. The chicken was cooked to perfection, the noodles had the perfect consistency, the egg was just right, the bamboo shoots were a nice touch, and the broth was absolutely to die for. I'd order this again in a heartbeat.  My husband had the dan dan noodles with beef and loved them as well-- I tried a taste and really enjoyed, just not as much as my ramen.  Panfried miso garlic dumplings were also excellent.  He enjoyed the house sake, and I had an on tap Sapporo-- they don't have liquor (yet, maybe) but they have a great beer list and respectable wine options.

I wouldn't have known about this place if it weren't for a friend who's a friend of the proprietors, but I'm so glad she told me about it so I can tell Yelp and all my friends. ||| Everything tasted yummy! Can't wait to for them to expand their menu! The chicken curry has a Smokey flavor I loved! The shrimp dumplings with the Siracha were a go to. ||| SO delicious. SO friendly.  Great, knowledgeable  staff, working well together. Asked for pescatarian ramen...chef came out to tell us when they were prepping mahi. Miso garlic dumplings perfect and light. Ramen soul satisfying. Recommendations on point. A very happy birthday indeed! First visit, but not the last! ||| We came during the soft open a week or so ago. The yakitori was perfectly cooked and packed a lot of flavor. We also ordered dumplings, tacos, ramen, and dan dan noodles--it was a great spectrum of tastes and textures, and all were quite good. I wasn't really feeling much heat from the ""extra spicy"" dan dan noodles, but at this point, my spicy sensors might just be dead inside. The blistered or charred peppers in the sauce added a nice overall balance. 

There were a couple inconsequential service speed bumps, but that should be expected at a soft open. I look forward to coming back here once they are in full swing! ||| Great food.    I loved the spicy ramen especially.    In a small strip mall but don't let that keep you away.   Definitely worth going to give them a try ||| The spicy chicken ramen is amazing, haven't had a bad dumpling yet, and the house sake is very generous.  Definitely a hidden gem in this part of town! ||| Had my first meal here and it was fantastic!  The food was super tasty, fresh and flavorful.  Great and friendly service as well.  We had pan fried shrimp dumplings with miso garlic sauce and they were super crispy and tasty.  The cucumber salad was light and refreshing with a sweet and tangy dressing.  I finished the meal with the special ramen with chicken.  That broth was very flavorful and thr chicken added a smoky, savory note.  Can't wait to come back and try some more dishes! ||| Went for lunch. Not too busy. Waited on immediately. Very friendly.  

Amazing food. I had the Dan Dan beef noodles. Bursting with flavors and a nice heat that really set this off.  The thin noodles and minced beef were perfect.  This was my kind of food and prep !   

Deb ordered the dumplings.  So good !  She got it as a meal but definitely get this as an app as it is a great sharable.  They go quick cause they are so good. 
 We plan to go back just to have all the dumplings ! 

As others have noted this is an un assuming place in a strip mall but the unassuming stops at the door.  The food is awesome and made fresh.  

Can't wait to go back and try something else as well as make it to one of their chef's tables. ||| Food was excellent. The owner and team were extremely hospitable. Definitely worthy of a repeat performance.  Try this place if you want unique and delicious food. ||| Asian fusion restaurant with small menu.  For the price for the dishes, the portion is small.  Four dumplings for $8,  tortilla breaks, the ribs doesn't look good, but actually very tasty.  What I ordered were just ok, maybe other items are better.",12,30,147171,58.6
70623,"Miller's is a decent sports bar, with a pretty large menu if you want to grab a bite to eat and watch a sporting event on one of their many televisions. Plus, its proximity to Raymond James Stadium make it a good option for a meal before a Tampa Bay Buccaneers or USF Bulls' football game.

They have mojitos on special for happy hour, and while they are tasty, they took a really long time to arrive.  Both times we ordered them, the waitress had to apologize for how long they took; our appetizer actually came out before the first round.

We started with an order of chips and guacamole, which also came with salsa.  It was a good size portion, but I thought the guacamole was just okay-it didn't have much flavor.  For my meal I had the blackened chicken quesadilla.  It too was just okay.  I do love, however, that I could substitute the rice & beans for French fries. Winner! The fries were delicious.  And, my boyfriend liked his turkey burger, so I think next time I'll be much happier ordering a burger and fries.

Service was fine, food was fine, drinks were good, and I'm sure I'll be back eventually. ||| This location is great. The outside covered seating is great to grab a drink after work. Their deal on 23oz Shock Top draft beer is amazing and worth checking out. On this trip I ordered the Zinger's flatbread pizza which is one of my favorites. Service was great as always and I will definitely be back. ||| This place is so good. My favorite meal to get is the zinger salad. I absolutely love the atmosphere and the customer service. It is very laid back and casual. I usually come here with my family because I know everyone can come here and have a good time and I don't have to feel like we have to use our six inch voices. I look forward to visiting again. Thank you for the great service. ||| I usually love eating at Ale house because of their Mountain Melts but this past time was COMPLETELY horrible. We bought 5 mountain melts and we were all disappointed with the portion size. They raised the price and gave us a smaller bowl. Then there was a paper under the food like wax paper and it got stuck to the cheese and the food, making it even harder to eat! We are very loyal customers but every time we order food it gets worse and worse. ||| Ordered takeout tonight, the twin lobster tail dinner.  
One lobster was fine. The other was spoiled.  Any chef could tell that it was by the cottony texture.  It  was mushy.  Highly disappointed. This is why ordering takeout sucks.  You don't realize the food is bad until you're home. ||| I was a bit disappointed with my experience here. I called ahead of time to verify they would be showing the boxing fight later that evening. I show up and had to ask for them to put preliminary fights on a tv for me watch because it wasn't showing on any tv. Then at 9pm when the main events were on pay per view, I had to ask for them to change the channel. The entire time music was playing instead of the audio from the fight. It wasn't until about 10pm when they turned the audio from the fight on. The explanation given to me was it was children in the restaurant so they don't turn the audio from the fight on until closer to the main event. If I had known this ahead of time, I would have NEVER gone to this location to watch the fight. I go to different Ale House locations all the time to watch fights, and will never return to this particular location. By the time I realized watching the fight would be a hassle here, all the other bars in the area showing the fight were packed and I wasn't guaranteed to be able to sit. That's the only reason I stayed at Ale House. And the bartender makes a terrible Old Fashioned drink. ||| Very impressed with the quality of the food, the fries and the draft beers were delicious, including the service. I think our server was Chelsie (don't remember her name completely), she was super nice. I highly recommend this location to anyone in the area. ||| I just walked in on a Sunday and waited over 10 minutes at a table to get greeted, went to the bar and sat another 5 minutes with no bartender in sight, and finally left. I am so disappointed. I haven't been to an Ale House in so long and was very excited. I even left the Bucs game early to get here and avoid ""the crowd"". Well there's not a crowd and now I know why, this place is a joke. Thanks for wanting my business as much as I wanted to give it to you. ||| This is my second time at Miller's Ale House. The first trip in Chicago was not a great experience and I honestly wasn't planning to return. However, after being contacted by the manager I received a request for a second chance and figured I would give it a try. 

From the minute you walk in the staff is warm and helpful. The place has a trendy vibe with long list of beers on tap. Came in with my son and had a good experience. Our waiter Gabe was very friendly and helpful from the start. I would probably come in again mainly based on his great service. He offered his opinions and was honest when it came to what he thought were not the best options. This further enhanced my trust in him and went with some of his recommendations. The ossobuca was amazing and came with mashed potatoes, gravy and broccoli. Definitely would order again. The jambalya tastes delicious but extremely salty. Manager walked by and I mentioned it but offered to still eat it as I was hungry. He insisted he wanded to fix it. They were happy to replace but the second plate now didn't have the same flavor and immediately you could see a difference in the color. However, the jambalaya was still decent and was taken off the bill even without me even requesting it. All in all it was a good experience and will give come back. ||| Great service for lunch!!! Had me out in less than 30 minutes! Hot food-superior service! Manager knew I was in a hurry and cashed my check out!!! ||| Saw this place when I was searching for a place to go for Friday night. A place that is close to my location and I can say that they do have a nice ambiance. Have not tried any of there food but I do noticed that they have special every night. My experience was okay and planning to visit the place again and try the ribs. ||| This was my #1 place to go to in Tampa. Our server Stephanie was phenomenal! She was knowledgeable, was super fast and very attentive. I'd give this place 10 stars if I could. They were generous with their food portions and the shots were huuuuge!! ||| We were in town for the weekend and wanted a place to watch college football.  We happened to drive past Miller's and thought we would give it a try.  We sat at the bar and had a few cocktails.  We couldn't decide what we wanted to eat, but after watching plate after plate of the nachos come out, that's what we decided on.  The smell was the first to intrigue us.  The size could feed a small village.  The nachos did not disappoint.  They were great. The wait staff was phenomenal. Our glasses were never empty.  They were friendly and even checked in to see if our teams were winning.  We will be back if in Tampa again. ||| Atmosphere is nice but the food not so much. Worst food I have ever eaten and this is from a man who has eaten prison food . I had the Cajun chicken pasta and it was the most bland meal I have ever had two bites of it and I was ready to rip my tongue out so I could scrub my palate .If you like bland food over cooked pasta this the place for you. But if you enjoy good food don't eat here. ||| Extra Extra Read All About It! Miller's Ale House on14803 North Dale Mabry in Tampa Florida was recommended to us by a friend. We are here on vacation. We typically don't eat at the same place twice, but Miller's Ale House is the exception. We have been there three times in less than a week. The menu selection is perfect a mixture of sea food, bar food and southern flavors, and classic Americana. From the minute you walk in you know you have found your Cheers! The wait staff not to mention any names, hostess JuJu is Super Nice and Justin our server today who I must say was outstanding! He is a GREAT server, we enjoyed our conservation and tidbits info on wineThe other two servers Jessica and Emily were also good servers. My wife and I are going there again just before we leave town. To all that are reading this, make it a priority on your visit to Tampa to get to Miller's Ale House, and if you are a local this will be your new hang out! Enjoy! Kudos to Mike the Manager, he is AWESOME, & Big Thank You for taking the time to chat w usA Big Thank you to Lance for his hospitality ||| This Ale House location has a horrible kitchen and lacks quality control. I've visited various Ale Houses around Florida for the last 20+ years. Went tonight, Feb 5, 2021 to this Tampa Ale House. Ordered the Cheese Curds, they were tiny almost like peanuts and bland with a honey/oil sauce that didn't pair well. (Update: it's not honey, just a tasteless high fructose corn syrup they try to pass as honey). Never will I order that again!!!

Ordered the Zingers in Korean BBQ sauce and didn't have much flavor either. Ordered the 35 Shrimp platter, with Sweet Potato Fries. They Messed up the order and brought regular fries, which were soft, bland, soggy and not fully cooked. (Saving money on seasoings) I ended up getting my Sweet Potato Fries after I brought up the mistake to the waiter. And they even got the sauce wrong that I had ordered on the side.

The Sweet potato fries were also bland, no seasoning and needed to be cooked further to be a bit more firm and crispy.

Also, the side of Coleslaw that came with my shrimp and that comes with just about every fried plate comes in a tiny 2oz sauce container. It doesn't even qualify as a side and was warm, tasteless, no seasoning, drenched in liquidity/watery mayonnaise and not fresh at all. I guess most people just throw it out, so Ale House doesn't bother to make it any better since it's trash. Most other restaurants focus on giving a better coleslaw side with their dishes but NOT ale house. They should just take it off the menu listing!!!

The breaded Shrimp was also bland and tasteless. I asked the waiter what was going on with the quality and he called Fidel the manager.

I expressed my concerns and told him about the quality of the food. Apparently, he said he would bring it up to the kitchen, the chef and let Corporate know about the issues. I don't think I will be returning to this location again. It's a shame they are lacking the quality compared to other locations. Plus, the next day my wife and I were sick in the bathroom and upset stomach. I think it might have been the spongy, processed, Cheese curds or bad fermented Coleslaw.

UPDATE: General Manager John called on Feb 6, to give me an explanation after I Ieft my feedback/comments on the Ale House Corporate Website. His explanation;
The Cheese Curds are purchased pre-made from a vendor and I must have received the left over crumbs from the bottom of the batch, like the leftover pieces in a bag of chips.
The Coleslaw is not a side dish or accompaniment to the meal, but rather a garnishment to aid in digestion. And it was supposed to be served in a slightly bigger 4 oz cup, BUT that's not what I received.  Plus, he states I got the leftover from the batch that must have stayed out too long and the acids broke it down. However, in the menu, they show Coleslaw as a side, not a garnishment to aid in digestion. I didn't know Ale House was in the Homeopathic business that they needed medicine to help you digest their food. And as for the blandness, he confirmed they don't add any seasonings to their Sweet Potato fries or French Fries. And he did admit, that if they aren't cooked long enough, they wouldn't be crispy and would be further tasteless.

OVERALL, I GIVE UP on Ale House and their lousy their pre-purchased, pre-made, artificial, generic, tasteless dishes. ||| Definitely not a fan. A friend and I sat at the bar for lunch thinking we would get faster service. It took 15 minutes for the bartender to come over and take our drink orders. After waiting another long amount of time she was ready to take our food order. My friend got the fish, shrimp and clam combo and I got a burger medium. His food came out without the fish and my medium was still practically bleeding. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Stay away unless you like paying for food you don't get or undercooked 
Update: I added the feedback to their website as the manager requested. ||| My husband and my infant son who was in a stroller came in to have some lunch on 11/14/21 and they told us they had open tables but our stroller was to big and couldn't seat us that it would have been an inconvenience for the workers and other customers. I have worked in the customer service industry for 7 years and have never turned away customers due to having a stroller. Such a terrible place to go to if you have a small infant apparently! ||| Still consistent as the worst Ale house ever. The service is always terrible. Got sat after waiting 25 minutes for a table, then never got a sever to our table. We waited another 17 minutes and nothing. Not one person said a word to us..... amazing at this point. ||| My husband had I were looking forward to having the rib special they offer on Monday nights.  We have always enjoyed them and the price. We haven't been in awhile and we went tonight.  The price is still good but the quality wasn't like they have been in the past.  They were smaller and less meatier. The baked potatoes used to be good size but small tonight.  My ribs were over done to the point they were dry and I  had burnt areas which wasn't pleasant tasting. The waitress never asked how our food was. We ordered double butter for the potatoes and didn't get. When my husband asked her for more she just brought one butter. Potatoes were dry. We use to love the bake potatoes there. 
When I was able to get her attention again I let her know the ribs were on the overdone side and dry and asked for bbq sauce to put on, she didn't even care and walked away and came back with the bbq and dropped it off. The server wasn't attentive. It was a disappointing night. We were not satisfied. ||| Walked in at 4:30pand waited 5 minutes to be seated (by the way, they were not busy). After being seated we waited 15-minutes and got no service or introduction from any staff. Also, the outside was trash city. Cups, bottles, broken glass and more. Should have figured the way the outside was would carry inside. Won't be back. ||| Disappointed for sure, it's like they just threw Zingers and fries with cheese cheese cled it a dish, mediocre at best..
 Get the Zingers alone... ||| Consistently good food and good service. Love the new layout of these restaurants. Very open and inviting. Great outdoor bar area with seating.   

Lunch specials are a good value and all other menu items are on par for a sports bar venue. Wings are large and avg $1/ea. The chicken nachos are huge but are now $11 (I remember when they were $7!). They are known for zinger melt which is chicken tenders, sauced and topped with melted cheese and sour cream. Tasty! Kids fried shrimp platter is a good value for the little ones. 

Bar has great specials with double Captain or Absolut drinks for $5.50 and Miller pitchers for $8. Late night weekday drink prices are even better. 

Plenty of parking at this location. Staff is attentive. Overall great place to catch a game. 

History Note: chain was started in Jupiter FL by Jack Miller. No affiliation with Miller beer. ||| Terrible experience from the start- wasn't even greeted and or asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. And when we were seated, we were all the way in the back right next to the kitchen, where we couldn't see any of the TVs. When I walk into a sports bar, usually we would want to watch the sports. Crazy thing is, the place wasn't busy at all. When we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, we received broken/stale chips and the dip wasn't full and was crusty and cold. Otherwise our server, Kendall was great and she was upfront that she just started, but the kitchen and staff were horrible. ||| Been to this location 3 times the new chicken sandwich is really good highly recommend this also had the other chicken sandwich (big red ) and one of there burgers all good nice atmosphere ||| Me and my family normally dine at this location on a regular basis and receive decent service. However, last night bar manager Dave completely ruined our dining experience by escalating an issue that could've easily been resolved.

Terrible customer service and managerial skills. Dave was clearly overwhelmed with the amount of customers in the establishment and became very emotional when we did not like our drinks.

Hopefully the next time we visit, a better manager will be available to actually provide quality customer service to loyal customers. ||| Super attentive service, good food, good drinks. Absolutely no complaints! Sat outside on the patio and we were taken care of promptly and had little to no wait for any of our drinks, and our food came out super fast too! Definitely will come here again and will suggest to any friends coming into Tampa ||| I was impressed, I didn't expect the food to be as good as it was. I had the shank, I must say I will be back.  Sorry I didn't take any picture , ||| Miller's is always spot on and if for any reason they are not they will make it right. Love the Zinger's!  It's a nice casual vibe with sweet servers. My only feedback would be for management to teach servers not to place open straws in the drinks.  Especially in Florida, the use of plastic drinking straws is becoming more and more frowned upon. If a customer requests one ok, or leave them on the table but PLEASE do not put them in our drinks! ||| I have never walked out of a restaurant before but, after sitting down at our table for 20 minutes with no service, and 3 cranky hungry children.... We left. 
This was after telling the host and another server that no one had come by. 
The table next to us was sat while we were waiting and had a server immediately. The server at the table across from ours totally disregarded we were there.
So annoying.
Do better. ||| My husband had I were looking forward to having the rib special they offer on Monday nights.  We have always enjoyed them and the price. We haven't been in awhile and we went tonight.  The price is still good but the quality wasn't like they have been in the past.  They were smaller and less meatier. The baked potatoes used to be good size but small tonight.  My ribs were over done to the point they were dry and I  had burnt areas which wasn't pleasant tasting. The waitress never asked how our food was. We ordered double butter for the potatoes and didn't get. When my husband asked her for more she just brought one butter. Potatoes were dry. We use to love the bake potatoes there. 
When I was able to get her attention again I let her know the ribs were on the overdone side and dry and asked for bbq sauce to put on, she didn't even care and walked away and came back with the bbq and dropped it off. The server wasn't attentive. It was a disappointing night. We were not satisfied. ||| Not horrible but typical chain food. Service is good though which is nice. Large location which is helpful if you have a big group. Definitely not my choice place in Tampa but simple and consistent. ||| Thursday night football made this place swell like a huge pimple on a 5 year olds face... :) Ok enough of my boring analogy / they were absolutely slammed!!! No seating, 1.5hour wait, but Kayla (Kaylin), Management, and the Kitchen staff were phenomenal! While we waited, Kayla (Kaylin) kept us hydrated - she was amazing! In the midst of a super crowded restaurant, she walked from table to table, and thought enough of us to ask if we needed anything while we waited. Once we were sat, the food came out fresh, hot, plated, and did not lack presentation! Nice job Miller's Ale House, You handled the pressure perfectly and made diamonds!!! Many times when restaurants experience crowds like this, they fold and quality takes a back seat to speed! They did not fold!! Every bar tender we saw, every Wait staff, every Manager we're moving, smiling, and nice! I'm sure mistakes were made, but we didn't feel them!! Kudos for making my pre-game epic!!! ||| LOVE the outside bar. Great staff, good selection of beer and several different types of seating areas. $2 Miller Lites during Happy Hour and plenty of other drinks and food specials. We ate inside and the atmosphere there was good too. On to the food. I had the mahi mahi. It was a touch overdone but overall a great sandwich. A nice big piece, with a simple but delicious charbroiled flavor. It might have even REALLY been mahi too. At our table there was also a bunch of other stuff. Flatbread - looked ok, lots of toppings to choose from. 35 shrimp - lots of breading, little shrimps, but what do you expect for about $10?! Wings - nice and hot, with several sauces to choose from. The star of the evening was the smoked fish spread though. It's seriously good. The service as super friendly but not 100% quick or accurate. They have only been open a couple of weeks though, hopefully it's just growing pains. Good place, we'll go back. ||| They need better or more experienced servers. The service was way too slow. The wings were fatty so if you order wings go with the boneless Zingers. The piña colada had no alcohol whatsoever although the I told the waitress I wanted it strong. The location is good and the environment with perfect. They need to work on the speed of service. ||| Stopped in to get a quick bite and sat at the bar & had 2 very friendly and cheerful servers who were very attentive & I thought it was so awesome that they had little tent cards that had my name on the side facing the bartenders and on my side of the cards, it had my servers names. How thoughtful & cool! 

I ordered the Apple Walnut Salad and got it with grilled shrimp, which wasn't one of the options, but they made it happen for me (they just keep getting cooler by the minute!) 

The apple vinaigrette dressing was yummy and I got that on the side. The salad had fresh, crispy chunks of apples, candied walnuts, blue cheese and craisins in it. Yummy! 

Now the real reason I ordered a salad was so that I could get my hands on their signature dessert, Captain Jack's Sundae. Yummm Oreos, Heath bar, ice cream layered and sitting in a shallow bowl of fudge. So so good! I even offered to share with the stranger next to me, but he declined. Do I ate his share. Haha! 

Great new spot! Plenty of big tv's and comfy spaces to sit. ||| Pretty crappy night at Miller Alehouse by tampa airport on a Wednesday night.  It was our first time visiting. My 22 yr old son and I went to eat at the outside bar to have dinner and watch kickoff to NHL hockey season. Found out they didn't subscribe to NHL Center Ice to watch the game.  My son wanted a streak or prime rib for dinner to celebrate his job promotion.  We ordered prime rib from the bartender but apparently we didn't hear her say that they only have prime rib on Thursday and they only have a shaved prime rib sandwich dip.  Lots to miss.  But ok. My son was pretty disappointed when he wanted a prime rib and got basically a philly cheese steak sandwich. I ordered chicken wings and a loaded baked potato.  The loaded baked potato came out so incredibly cold AND the wings were so undercooked that there was blood  oozing from the wings. Unfortunately for me, I ate one of them before I realized they were so undercooked (I took pictures in case I get sick). A very bad night.  To their credit, the bartender and restaurant manager tried to make it right but the damage was as already done. ||| Really nice sports bar and I like the patio bar area. Lots of TVs for sports. Will post again when I get my meal. ||| Glad to see the Ale House in the Tampa area. Was really disappointed tonight with both the food and service.  I personally got up from my table 3 times to get my own drinks for me and my guests. I feel as though this happens often as no one seemed to mind a customer making himself at home in the server station. 2 out of 3 entrees were done well, but my ossobuco was torched and dryed out, the broccoli on my plate was brown on over half of the serving, and dramatically undercooked. Some were even cold to the touch...come on Ale House, I'm rooting for you but step your game up! ||| Food was great.  Service was pretty good.  I would've given them 5 stars.

Why only 3 stars?  I sat at the bar and watched the bartender (Jenn) over-serve 2 guys sitting at the bar.  They were in no condition to drive, yet I saw them both get into their respective cars and leave.

She had to ask them how many drinks they had before giving them their bill.  

How many other patrons has she over-served?  Irresponsible service potentially resulting in a very tragic situation.

Ale House - please fix this. ||| So, I'm going to try this again because my first was removed by Yelp. This is exactly how I had written it. I was in Tampa visiting my oldest daughter under some really tragic circumstances. We were starving and decided to try Miller's Ale House. What a bad decision we made! Everyone ordered something different so we could all have a bite of each other's plate. What a horrendously wrong decision I made. I spent more than 75.00 at this establishment. I could have easily gone to a fast food restaurant and spent a good 35.00 and been satisfied. I will be going back to Tampa in the very near future, what will not be in my plans is Miller's Ale House. ||| I regretfully admit a mistake in my part in writing a review of Miller's Ale Hou
se  (Airport Location.) This was the wrong location! My apologies for any disservice to your restaurant! ||| Love this place! Five stars for the amazing fries. Cartell is a great manager and Emily and Jen are awesome bartenders! You'll love this place! ||| Lunch is super busy but great food and great service.km Sadie was very helpful and nice when I was there.will recommend it to friends. ||| Today we experienced terrible service. We came in for the chief and chargers game and the place was empty. We had a party of 15 and there was more than enough tables to sit together or close together. 3 servers started to argue with eachother in front of us and the manager came and was oblivious to what was going on. The servers continued to argue so the manager cut them and told us he didn't have enough servers to serve us. Terrible terrible experience. We definitely would not be coming back. ||| I really like this MAH (Millers Ale House) better than any other that I have been to. The good thing about this popular chain is that the food is pretty consistently good overall. I really like the amount of TV's this location has to offer though most other MAH locations have plenty of TV's, they're just older and some, not that big.

Most previous visits to every MAH over a period of 10 years have been fine. The last couple of visits, not so much so. Both times I made a special request to have something cooked to my liking and both times that request was either ignored or not passed along to the kitchen. I'm not picky when I dine out and will rarely ever complain about anything. I don't expect perfection but I do expect that a simple request be honored. Also, the last time I went here, to the Tampa location, the service at the bar (inside) was not very good. The bartenders were not very friendly or attentive and it wasn't even that busy.

I'll still probably go back again in the future because like I said,  overall, MAH is usually a pretty solid place to watch sports and grab a bite to eat. ||| Let knew start by saying that I have been frequenting other Miller Alehouse for years and have always enjoyed everything I have gotten. I frequent the Brandon and Fowler location and have enjoyed many things including the zingers, chicken nachos, prime rib special on Thursday, fajitas, and chicken nachos. That being said I am truly disappointed with this location! I went here once when they first opened and tried my favorite meal from this chain the Cajun chicken pasta. It was salty and didn't taste good but figured this place just opened so I'll give them a pass. I went here again last night and got chicken nachos to go and they were disgusting! For anybody who has ever ordered these know it's enormous! This was smaller then normal with barely any chips and the few chips left were soggy and small hard pieces of chicken. I love cheese but all this tasted like was soggy cgeesy corn slop! On the side they gave me three things of sour cream,  a full container of jalapenos, and half a container of lettuce and salsa (or tomatoes?). I was so upset I didn't check this when I got home! The chicken is normally plentiful and tasty and this tastes like cardboard that sat out all day. The only reason this place has two stars us because I got there around 10 pm after finishing work and they bartender who served me was nice and quickly helped me. Do not plan on returning again! ||| Great place to see all of the Saturday college football games . Also I just love their daily specials and the best wings in Tampa . The Ghirardelli Chocolate Brownie Sundae and the Captain Jack's Buried Treasure is the best . ||| Had our company's beginning of the year outing here. We rented out the back bar area and had drinks and a food bar available. Drinks were good, I had a mule and it was actually very delightful. The food was just ok but typical of a bar. There was artichoke dip with chips which the dip had no flavor at all, was also very watery like it was frozen before heating up. Mozzarella sticks were good, but the winner of the evening was the chicken wings. The mozzarella sticks were not that warm despite being on a warmer and once again seemed frozen since the cheese was not even melted or attached to the breading when biting into them. ||| This is one of the newer Millers Ale House and we stopped in for a late Sunday lunch while out shopping.  Again, another five star experience eating wings, salad, and cold beer.  Our server was on top and the atmosphere was relaxed but sports oriented.  If you like a lot of TVs with multiple sorts programs, great food and nice seating then this is for you.  We did not sit outside but for those who enjoy this then there is a space dedicated to you, includes a full device bar! ||| Great experience and everything you'd expect from an Ale House.  Glad to see another one pop up in the area!  We visited Friday night. The bar was very crowded but hey had misting fans above that were amazing.  We sat inside.  Ordered the amazing chicken nachos that we have come to love as an Ale House staple for the last 15 years.  We had two orders at our table. Funny thing was they were ordered exactly the same and came out completely different.  Would like to see more consistency.  We also would have ordered more drinks than the two we each had, but we rarely saw our waitress.  In fact, we once walked to the bar for a round!  I understand the location is new, I'm hoping they work out the service kinks in time.  Ale House is always a great place to go! ||| Miller's Ale house is located off Spruce just 2 blocks from International Mall on Tampa. Miller's ale house has great drink specials on every day except Saturday but I'd avoid some of their food. I'm not a picky eater but I tried 5 different dishes and was only a fan of 2 of them. I highly recommend the grilled steak fajitas. I got them medium rare and the steak was very tender and succulent. The fajitas are even better than chili's! The oven baked Thai chili chicken zingers are also pretty good. My cheeseburger with sautéed onions and mushroons was cooked well done and burnt instead of medium rare and was the worst burger I ever had. It had this terrible smoky burnt flavor, was dry, not juicy, and a lot less thick than other burgers I usually get at other restaurants, and the bun fell apart on me while I was eating the burger. Miller's ale house was hardly generous with their serving of fries. I have gotten more fries at every other restaurant I've ever been to. 70 percent of sides you could order with your meal were an up-charge.  I can understand charging extra for a side salad but I can't understand charging extra for a loaded baked potato or sweet potato fries. Not even Berns steakhouse charges extra for a loaded baked potato. The shrimp Tacos I got were completely inedible, the worst I've ever had, and had to be sent back. The Cajun chicken pasta used old dried parsley from a shaker you get at Walmart for 50 cents instead of the real deal fresh parsley and felt over seasoned and cheap. My friend regularly gets Cajun chicken pasta at the Brandon miller's ale house location and said it was way better there and couldn't eat the one here. I used to love going to the Gainesville location at UF and loved their wings. Perhaps the cooks in the kitchen at this location are just terrible and need to be brought up to  the consistency standards with the rest of the other franchise locations. The host was gracious enough to put the gator game on for the TV in front of our table but then we couldn't find anyone to switch it over to the USF game after the gators were done playing and won. I asked for spicy mustard for my burger and fries, but by the time the waitress brought out the spicy mustard 10 minutes later, I had already finished the few fries that I got. It took another 20 minutes to flag down the waitress to close us out with the check. There is a paved parking lot that fills up pretty quick so people have to park in the grass usually. Miller's ale house serves liquor and lots of locally brewed brews and has great drink specials during the week. I'll be back for drinks like $2.50 sauza margaritas on Fridays 11am-7pm. Try Duffys next door off South Dale Mabry next to Target for way better sports bar food if you are craving anything other than fajitas. ||| Our first time at a Miller's, came as a result of friends recommending the Prime Rib Thursday night special.  We give kudos to manager, Eli, for his genuine & thorough customer service, our waiter Justin for his attentiveness & cordiality, & whoever created &/or chef'd the French Onion crock.  They were all excellent.

On the ""weren't as enamored"" side of the ledger we'd cite the chewiness (toughness) of most, but not all, of the medium rare prime rib.  Second, there was an ""offensive bite"" to the minced garlic in the Garlic Parmesan sauce on my Zingers...need to find an alternative source for our prepared garlic, one packed in less-chemical-tasting-liquid.

The wine, baked potato, cole slaw, value, & ambiance of this eatery were all fine.  We'll be back if for no other reason than to get some more of their awesome French Onion soup, but we'll try other entrees on future visits. ||| I really enjoy Miller's Ale Houses.  This is the second location I have enjoyed.    Food is fine, service is good, atmosphere is fun and there is something for everyone on the menu.  Please, Please, Please consider bringing a Miller's Ale House to Trinity FL!  Our area is growing so rapidly and we have very limited fun restaurants.  Miller's Ale House would be a wonderful fit for the growing young professional's building homes and the active older residents that have been driving to Tampa, Dunedin, Oldsmar for far too long! ||| This is probably one of my favorite restaurants to go to. The food is awesome you get a lot for the money. The atmosphere is great, waiters and waitresses are very kind I will definitely be back again!!!! ||| Really great place!  I have read some reviews knocking this place for bad service and noise levels.  I can only assume after my visit here, that on both issues, it was because they were....hold onto your hats people......BUSY! Go figure!  A sports-bar type place, busy.  A place that offers fantastic food choices, a better than average selection of draft beer on tap, daily specials that are actually worth it, Late night happy hours, a staff that cares and interacts well, two large dining areas, outdoor seating, and TV's EVERYWHERE with a very wide variety of stuff on the lot. So....was it loud? Yes. Was it busy? Very.  Did it affect my food or overall dining experience??  Heck no.  Kudos to this establishment for making people WANT to come here and enjoy themselves! ||| Kind of slow service tonight......almost 15 minute wait before a waitress appeared to take our drink order. Food was good as usual but service remained slow on this very empty seated night. Unusual for this place.... ||| Great place to eat, drink and have fun! We can always see our favorite games and can always count on quality food and service! Never disappointed! ||| First appearance is excellent. Bathrooms are five star for restaurant!! Very clean and maintained and lots of space. Water is very filtered and tastes great. Bar are is awesome and restaurant on its own with around twenty TVs for all of the games. I ordered the classic Burger. Great burger. Needed some salt and pepper but a great burger; freshly made and really juicy. Sweet potato fries are recommended. I wish there was one of these in Apollo Beach...it would crush!!! ||| Yeah, I want to like this place but I really can't.  And I am hoping everything I say here is just because I caught them on an off night.  This is more a 2 or 2.5 star review.  I think If I was at the bar, my experience would have been different, and I could see this as a place to go before a football game, or to catch a game on the tv.  But I will never know.

It starts with going in. A few second wait just to be given a raised table right behind where the hostess sits.  60% of the bar area was open, and you are going to seat two guys in town on business away from the bar and most of the TVs?  Ok.  Then the server took some time to get to us.  No real quick ""Hey I will be back in a second, or you guys look thirsty what can I get you?""  No it took him at least 5 minutes to join us.  I actually told my buddy we should go, but we stuck around.  After the server took the order, the drinks came pretty quick after that.  But it should have not gotten there.  They were not crowded, there was no rush.

So I got a Belgian beer and right away had a weird taste/funky bite to it.  I figured since it was a odd style, I chalked it up to that.  As the head disappeared, I found a fruit fly or something with wings in my beer.  The server was great, took it away, and brought me a new one.  I probably should have passed on that...  I went to an Ale House and just got one beer.  There is a problem here...

I had the ribs, as they were the special.  Nothing wrong with the ribs other than they just didn't peg my meter.  Didn't even move the needle.  I wished I could comment on them, but they didn't stand out as great or bad.  They just were.  My buddy got the fajitas.  Never saw lettuce with fajitas, but my buddy tells me I am crazy.  He may be right?

I don't get it?  The location probably drives their success, but I wouldn't come back. Maybe if I just did burgers and beer here, like a Budweiser, I will have a better experience.  But it is an Ale House.  And the off taste of that Belgian beer?  It was either the lines or the glass as I had the same beer at World of Beer for the next 3 nights.  Where it tasted wonderful with no funky bite.  (no, I don't work at WoB. It was just outside my hotel.)

Your mileage might vary folks, and I hope it does. ||| One of my Tampa faves. Food is always excellent although sometimes the service can leave a little to be desired. Great selection of beers and food. ||| Cartel is amazing, Emily and Jennifer are amazing. I live in land o lakes, specifically come for them. Amazing team amazing people! ||| This is the second time we ate at this location and both times service was SUPER SLOW. The server was barely around, and the food took forever.
It was late afternoon so it wasn't even in a ""peak time, the restaurant was basically empty.
I don't know if I want to eat here again with such a slow service. The food was good though. ||| We came here for the $5 Zingers they had advertised on Facebook... Our waitress was a little turned off when we showed her the post. The post neglected to inform that guests are supposed to sign up for their rewards program, not sure how true this is, but she let us order them anyways. We ordered waters, both dirty glasses. She gets us new ones, without saying a word, no sorry or anything... dirty again! So we get new ones... Surprise, dirty!! 3 rounds of dirty glasses and one round of dirty silverware. We are not neat freaks, by any means. But this was hard to swallow. We got our food and I had a hard time trusting how clean the plates were... We've always had a good experience here. The Zingers we ordered were OK, worth the 5 bucks. But between the not so friendly service and dirty kitchenware... We'll pass next time. ||| It's clean , it's new it perfect! Our food came out right away tastes amazing , waitress was super friendly and the drinks were strong. What could be better!! ||| Great place love the atmosphere and the food the ribs are the best!
Seat in the outer patio area by the fire. Great Place for a date! ||| The burgers are the absolute best thing I've ever tasted, but when your eating a burger worth 15$ and it's being served to you on a piece of paper and 1$ plastic silver plate you think twice. I would love if they could upgrade there plates to real plates and not stainless steal with a paper that can easily be ripped and end up in that delicious 15$ burger worth every penny ||| Is an Ale House. Nothing more, nothing less. If you've been to one, this one is no better nor worse. The food is ok, just like any other Ale House. 
The service of fine. I prefer sitting at the bar, the bartenders are better at taking care of the customers there. Is a fun, quick way to meet up with friends for an after work drink. I like it. ||| This location has a killer bar area that's outside and covered. Decent drink specials. And you can't go wrong with zingers. Day of the week food specials are usually a good deal. ||| Naturally, I wouldn't think to rate Miller's Ale House a 5 but then again I thought, why not! This place is open late, there are drink specials everyday, they have a selection of wine, the steaks cuts are 5 star restaurant grade (yes, thick cuts,) and the atmosphere is super chill. Basically, this place has something for everyone and YOU WONT BREAK THE BANK!!!!! 

Oh and the place is clean! So come EAT. DRINK. STAY AWHILE. ||| First of all, our server Anastasia was great. She was attentive and gave great service. The food on the other hand was awful. I ordered the steak fajitas and my boyfriend ordered the zingers. The fajitas came out NOT sizzling like most do. It was honestly just a sloppy mess of red onions (and their skin), peppers, and steak that was cut in huge pieces. The entire dish was soupy and tasted bland. Actually, the only flavor I could taste was the sweetness...that's it. To top it off, I also found a huge BLOOD VESSEL in my steak which really just killed the entire experience. 

The zingers were decent. ||| This is my parents and I favorite spot as of lately. The food is always delicious. My most recent order was the Macaroni with Zingers and I've got to give it up for them, their Mac n Cheese can hold its own. The Zingers are always pretty good. They really do know how to make some juicy chicken tenders. I especially love them with their mango habanero sauce. I will say that it was an interesting combo this time around with the macaroni in the mix. I'll still to mild for this meal next time. The service was great this last trip and usually always is. We didn't have to wait too long to be sat or to be served our food. My favorite thing about sports bar restaurants is the extreme amount of TVs they have all over the place, and Miller's definitely doesn't hold back. If you're looking for a chill place to watch the game on, then you should try this place out. ||| It's Millers y'all. Every time I come I get nostalgia of my old college days. $5 massive beer pitchers and amazing mount zinger melts with blue cheese and pico... all the food is so good.

What I most like about this one is that the wait staff seem nice and caring overall. Our waiter yesterday was named Gabe. Gabe was attentive to our orders and was just extremely nice to us.

We went random and got steaks instead of regular bar food this time - really because we were lazy to cool at home. The steaks were cooked properly to order and the sides turned out as expected. Yes granted it isn't Berns steaks but we're not comparing apples to apples here :) ||| A pretty average experience in my books.  Came in for late night happy hour and they did have a good selection of apps that were $5 during this special.  The service was a bit slow and food was ok at best.  They do have a lot of TVs so if you're trying to catch a game in a casual environment with average food this may be the place for you. ||| Really cool atmosphere. Went to watch the Cavs-Celtics game. Ordered the 35 shrimp alfredo but it came out really bland and it tasted like plain noodles. The alfredo sauce wasn't very thick. I mentioned it to them and they took it back.

The manager came out to apologize and took it off our bill and I got a half rack of ribs instead. Really good service and I'd go back again.

The setup outside is really cool too. ||| Great selection of beers on tap, very courteous staff, clean restrooms, lots of HD televisions, and conveniently located close to Steinbrenner Field. ||| I absolutely love Mille's Ale House; every-time I come here the service is phenomenal. Me and my wife came in to eat on a Friday night around 8:00 PM and it was the best service we have received since coming here. Our server was Nixon and he was delightful, our drinks were never empty and we had lots to drink. He answered every question we had about their beer and liquor selections and recommenced to try the local beer Coppertail Unholy and it was delicious. My wife got the mango pineapple mojito and she savored every sip and at the end of the visit we went over to the bartender which I believe his name was Vinny and tipped him a couple dollars for the fantastic drinks. We ordered the steak and chicken combo fajitas and their dinner special the coconut shrimp and it was delicious. Thank you Miller's Ale House for a great time; we will be back! ||| Absolutely loved the food tonight! The service was on point as well. Our waitress bailey refilled all of our drinks on time and checked on us multiple times. It's my second time here and I will most definitely come back! ||| My food and service was excellent! Didn't expect it,. .. yep!  Cancer in a Sunday about 5ish. ||| Millers ale house opened in 1988 in Jupiter Florida , 72 restaurants now and Tampa just opened their location right next to International plaza.

First trying a couple different menu options the veggie fajitas are amazing great flavor and a mix of steamed veggies makes it a vegetarians dream. 

Now onto the drink specials they do have a very overwhelming drink menu with the different times and special during the week, I was told guests usually get confused by the specials as there are so many different times and options. 

Late night happy hour starting out at 2$ cocktails 
But i noticed the bartenders weren't real knowledgable  of the drink special menu and they're menu online compared the to menu I saw was slightly off my a dollar or so.

I had a blueberry martini that was 3.00 and a dirty martini decent price for grey goose about 8.00

Give it a shot it's not glam it is an ale house still even though that it's brand new ||| Husband and I were there on Thursday 8/11. I am 3 1/2 months pregnant and have constant craving for crab legs. 

I sent my crab legs back because they were overcooked. The manager who took them back didn't even bother to come back to check on the second batch.

The second batch was also overcooked. 

When a different manager made the rounds to the tables, I told him what happened. I said he might want to check the cook knows how to cook crab legs or maybe the shipment wasn't good. 

When we were leaving the manager said to us as we were walking out the door, ""Hey, thanks for letting me know about the crab legs. Turns out, we had a bad batch back there. Thanks!""

We continued walking out, and we were like: so they just served us bad crab legs??? He didn't even offer us an apology for serving us bad crab legs. He could've given us a gift card so we'd return. 

Where is their quality control? Where is their customer service?

Disappointing compared to the location in Orlando on I-Drive. ||| Waited 8+ minutes for a refill on my beer while managers flirted with servers/did nothing. Matt was a good bartender and seemed to be the only one working outside. I'll be back in hopes that this was a one time thing! ||| Blown away by the service and food at this beautiful restaurant, I did not get to meet Miller, but everything else about this meal was perfect. Salmon was cooked to perfection and pro tip - get the Thai chili sauce on the side to make it even better. Can't wait to come back! ||| Came here for lunch with my co-workers as they wanted to come here. I didn't have good experience a day before at a sports bar style restaurant, so I wasn't really mood for coming here. 
Anyway, we wanted to sit outside, but it was full, so we had to sit down inside. 
I ordered fried clam po boy with fries from the lunch menu. 
Clams were so small and fries aren't hot nor fresh. 
Service and the staff were okay. Prices were reasonable, but I won't come back here for sure. ||| I really like Millers, I know it's a chain but a lot of choices and very good food. Service is friendly and efficient. ||| Just LOVE Millers! They have daily food specials that are a great value, drink specials and great variety of tvs for every game! Hint: get there early when Lightning are away!
For me the food is always consistent and a good quality. Large selection on menu, which they seem capable of preparing correctly. Servers and greeters are always friendly, attentive and professional. And it's a very comfortable setting. Pace of the meal is usually prompt and appropriate, plenty of well-lit parking. A very nice atmosphere and clientele. 
I'm always shocked when I do the 12.99 Wednesday steak special, at how good it is-quality, seasoning and always cooked as ordered. I can't tell you how many times at other ""steakhouses"" that I have to send back a MR steak- never at Miller's. Their Monday baby racks are great as well as their Thursday night prime rib . Truthfully, my complaint with the prime rib is that it's too big! (My dog never complains!)
I would like it more if they did two things: bring back lobster special nights and please eliminate that Captain Jacks ice cream cake that I find highly addictive to! 
Kudos to my rock star waiter , Preston/Axl , who was super attentive, funny, efficient and professional. 
Hey Miller's give the guy a raise! ||| Considering the huge amounts of rain that Tropical Storm Colin dumped on Tampa on June 6th, it turned out to be an unfortunate day for this new Miller's Ale House to open its doors to the public.

This location is the latest addition to always growing International Plaza/Westshore district, where I have been a proud resident since 2008.

Miller's Ale House opens roughly one month after Duffy's opened right down the street, giving great new options for those of us that enjoy a casual sports-themed atmosphere for lunch, dinner or late night. (I even noticed two managers from Duffy's actually sitting at the patio bar on this opening night around 8pm, enjoying themselves and checking out the competition.)

While Miller's Ale House has not changed very much since I first walked into their University location near UCF in Orlando over 20 years ago, the layout of this new free-standing store that was built from the ground up is particularly nice. Dare I say an upgrade from what I've been used to at other locations.

Like many other stores, there is the choice between being truly inside and totally enclosed or being on the open air patio which has a full roof but is not air-conditioned and allows for smoking at the bar and tables. This patio area is often warm and stuffy and the International location seems to be fighting a tough battle to keep this section at a comfortable temperature. 

Everything in terms of the food and drink options falls exactly in line with other locations and I did not notice any differences in price OR their always attractive late happy hour starting at 10pm, Sunday thru Thursday.

Again, because of the horrible weather conditions, there were more employees on the floor than customers. However, please note that there was absolutely no flooding around the store or in the perfectly paved and striped parking lot that seems large enough to accomodate a full house.

Somewhat disappointed that the audio of the Stanley Cup Final game was not being broadcast in any part of the restaurant. This makes me wonder how often this Ale House plans to air audio of meaningful primetime sporting events other than college or pro football games. However, the music played was at a perfect level for background noise...I just wanted to hear the great Doc Emrick calling the hockey game, which is why I left early on the first night. 

Welcome to my neighborhood and I hope your service and food quality make me as much of a regular customer as I am at Duffy's and of course the wonderful sports lounge at Lee Roy Selmon's. ||| Food was good. Service was absolutely terrible , place is awesome.  But crappiest service I've had in a long time. ||| This restaurant has the worst hospitality ever I was there with my family my wife and my two kids We walk in hostess didn't even greet us, we got our table we were there waiting between 10 to 15 minutes My son was hungry so we decided to leave we get up I tried to see if was a manager but I didn't see one
I try to tell the hostess what happened but seen she was busy and there's was no one else. I think no one has a proper training since in our way in and way out no one says hi or bye very disappointing

After almost a month no one contact me now I see what's the root of the problem the management they don't care so the employees follow their steps ||| Good and decently priced restaurant for the quality of food offered.

I had ribs and salad and everything was fresh and hot. Service was good and attentive but not overbearing and it's convenient that it's not so far from the airport. 

I didn't get a chance to get a beer but the selection looks good. Maybe never time I'm in town . ||| I went for the first time a few weeks ago after an event at Raymond James. It's not too horrible of a walk and much easier to come here and grab food and drinks and let the traffic clear before attempting to get an Uber. 

I really like the open patio seating, it was spacious and even though there was a crowd, you don't feel crowded. 

The service was painfully slow. We all finished an entire round of drinks before anyone came by for our order. You'd think on event nights, they'd better prepare and have adequate staffing. 

Our group ordered zingers, loaded fries, and potstickers to start. Nothing extraordinary--typical bar food apps. They also took nearly 30 minutes to arrive. 

I had the lime chicken salad and it was good. Again, nothing extraordinary. Some of the others tried the chicken philly, turkey burger, and a flatbread of some sort. Nothing was bad, but also wasn't anything I'd have to have again. 

Overall, fun environment and good location, but definitely not one of the places going into my must visit again list. Underwhelming. ||| Good bar food and excellent choice of drinks! 
I got a 20 count of wings and they tasted fresh and delicious. They have  many choices for bar food and even more! Our server was fantastic, she made sure our drinks were filled and that our food tasted good. Definitely recommend coming here for late night eats. ||| Hubby and I were seated right away. Looks like we're off to a good start....too bad it didn't last. We were seated for almost 10 minutes and still no one came to take our drink order. Hubs had to get up and ask for someone to come help us. Finally a pleasant server (Erica) came over and even though it wasn't her table, she saw no one had come by so she offered to take our orders. Since we'd plenty of time to study the menus, we knew exactly what we'd be having. We laid it all on her. Hubs order a tall craft beer, I opted for the Thursday drink special, a palm breeze, the creamy spinach dip to share, Hubs orders the steak and chicken fajitas and for me, I ordered the French onion soup and a baked potato. 

Beverages: well, it's a craft beer so of course it's good but the palm breeze was a glass of juice. 

Appetizer: delicious, but the chips were a bit salty. Some actually has piles of salt on them but most were just fine.

Main entrees: drum roll please.....they sucked. We'll start with mine. The French onion soup itself, tasted fine, but the cheese on top tasted like plastic wrapped sliced cheese. The baked potato was ok, but very dry and for some reason the whipped butter the gave on the side didn't melt in the hot potato. Very odd.
Now let's talk about Hubs fajitas. One bite and something seemed off. He thought it might be the seasoning so he took a bite of just the steak from the fajita plate and nope, it was bad. I mean sour bad. 

Now back to Erica, she came to check on us and when hubs told her it was no good, she took it away after offering to get him something else. He declined. At this point he couldn't get that taste out of his head. The manager stopped by and asked what the issue was and when we told him, he was surprised because all of their steak come in individually cryovac packages. Don't care, it was bad. He was apologetic and offered again to get Hubs something else, a dessert or even a beer, but we declined. 

Long story short, the staff is fantastic, the food, not so much. Now, I'm not telling you not to go here, all I'm saying is that if you do, and you too have a bad experience, don't say that I didn't warn you.


~Bob Appetite ||| Have you ever wanted to be classy but still wanted the sports bar vibe? Well this is not the place. It's a hooters where the servers wear regular clothes. Although the menu is fancy AF. With specials such as prime rib and coconut shrimp. Where am I?

Walked in at 11:38 pm. Place is open till 2. Hostess said kitchen closed at 11:30. Then she came back and said they close at 12. We were seated and the first work out of servers mouth were ""you know we close in 15 minutes"" 

It was my first time eating prime rib, so I'm not sure if it's supposed to come cold or not, but it was cold. But still good but like me before Keto: fatty. Too fatty. Like Kelly Clarkson after American Idol. 

At 12:00 on the dot, they turned on all the lights. I asked what time they close and they said 12:00. But yelp on Apple maps says it was open till 2:00. So someone it lying to me. 

2 out of 5. 4 out of 10. 48 out of 100. ||| Food: delightfully, unexpectedly yummy! I had veggie fajitas, veganized. They were good, but a little undercooked (crunchy, not quite sweet like grilled onions/peppers typically are). I love that I was able to veganize, though. Good selection of beer and great apps. The guacamole was lovely!

Service: extremely friendly server, but the kitchen screwed up my order which caused them to have to re-make it (they used butter and cheese originally, which was a sad waste). 

Ambiance: awesome outdoor space could have less misters and more fans, however, still very cool.

I will probably go back to try something else. :) ||| We are regulars at the Sarasota location.  Tampa experience was very disappointing.  Philly Cheese steak was served with a stale roll, cold steak and only 1 pepper, even though I paid extra.  Wife's prime rib was average, not that tender.  We will stick with Sarasota. ||| I was served jai alai in a goblet. The other ale House I get served in a regular pint. Last visit here ||| I usually love the Ale House. But tonight was pathetic. Never truly had the attention of the bartender. They were much more focused on the bigger parties present. Had to hunt for our own menus. When the food arrived, had to ask for silverware. Had to wave them down for a refill. Just disinterested all the way around. Now here's the real kicker.  We were done eating and after 38 minutes of waiting to see if they'd offer our check, I finally flagged one of them down for it. Ridiculous. Just because someone is in a smaller party doesn't mean they deserve less service. Everyone was nice. They just couldn't have cared less anyone else was there eating. ||| Why would I give this place 5 stars? Because I have absolutely nothing to complain about. Everything was awesome. The service, the food, the atmosphere...not one thing went wrong on my first visit. 

While parking looked tight upon arrival, I was guessing that seating would take some time. And I was wrong. We were seated immediately in a booth on college football opening Saturday. YAY #1! Our waitress Alexa/Foxy Brown was absolutely awesome (shoutout!!! She was super attentive, friendly and accommodating...she needs some recognition!). 

FOOD: The menu is comprehensive and there is literally something for everyone. I went with the 'world famous Zingers' which were absolutely delicious. I am a spicy sauce fiend so I got them hot with the Mt. St. Helen Insane sauce on the side. If you love the heat just go for it... to me it was manageable and I dipped everything in it! My lovely lunch date is very picky about Philly Cheesesteaks  but chose to order one here and devoured it! Said it was delicious. The simple fries are also delicious (warning: very seasoned so if you don't like salt you may not like them). We got the free flatbread to go...chose the Cheeseburger (sign up for the email club!). Ate it a few hours later and YUMMMMMMM delicious!! Exactly what I was hoping for. 

DRINK: So many specials. We went for the $10 Blue Long Island pitcher which gave us each around 3 glasses full each. Needless to say, a great option. They have soooo many great drink specials to check out. Not just on the weekdays but also on the weekends.

Great place to enjoy indoors and outdoors especially if you're looking to watch sports. Such a diverse menu of food and great atmosphere. Attentive service and great prices too! We walked out with a bill of around $30 (food and drinks). GO. Just GO! I'll be back!! Much more pleasant than surrounding sports venues! ||| Great food! Great service! The hostess was busy so the manager served us!! Got asked twice to get our order taken!! Food is on point. ||| My Cobb salad was good. My husbands hamburger was just ok. Not mush to say about the staff other than it took more than 5 minutes for someone to notice we where waiting to be seated. ||| First, we arrived on a Sunday around 2:30pm...game day. We got seated immediately and thankfully in Danielle's section. She was professional, friendly, and helpful! She suggested items, but never in a pushy way. She was very attentive but, at the risk of redundancy, not pushy or over the top. Our food order was pretty straightforward, a Blackened Shrimp/Chicken Cobb salad, and Steak Fajita. The food seemed to take a lot longer than we expected but we were not in a hurry so, no biggie. Danielle checked on us, assured us our food was coming, and made sure our drinks remained full. I would give this review a 5 but we waited a bit too long for our food. That being said, be sure to ask for Danielle, you won't be disappointed! ||| Went 7/28/17 for dinner and drinks. We sat at the bar as we always do at every Ale house.  We noticed how hot it was and asked bartender why and was told AC was broke. We almost left after our first drink but Taylor and Dimitri were so nice we decided to stay because of them.  We had the pepperoni flat bread always good and buffalo chicken sandwich.  We spoke to the manager Mike I think and he explained about the AC and what happened. He as well was very nice (he had beautiful eyes) :) ||| Love the Pork Osso Bucco!  You can't go wrong at Miller's Ale House. Lost of great food and plenty of TV's to watch your favorite games. They have a lot of beers on tap as well. 

Being close to the Tampa Airport helps too if your gonna turn in your rental car and fly out. Great place for the total dining experience. ||| Great nice new place.  Awesome selection of both food and drinks. I tried the zingers, very good ||| This is the place that me and another manager at my job go to often for lunch. This is our little get-a-way when we are having a stressful week. The food is really good. The portions are pretty big for the price you pay. They have plenty of seating options. The TV's are amazing. I swear I think there are probably 100 TV's all over the place. All kind of different things playing on them from news, to sports, to whatever. The noise level is pretty loud, you are not having a quiet intimate conversation here at all. This is a great location, plenty of parking, and plenty of room inside. Every time we have been it's been really clean. There have been places I have gone and in the middle of rush hour the floors are sticky, or stuff spilled on the floor but not here. Everything is clean, there is not stickiness on the tables. I will continue to go back over and over as long as they keep up the great work. ||| This place is good place to eat good food at a reasonable price nice ppl and good service the Blacken turkey Burger is awesome it's hard believe it's turkey it doesn't taste like it! ||| This alehouse by the stadium is a great place to go to watch the game to drink at the bar in my opinion the food is just mediocre but it's definitely a fun place to go they always play the UFC fights and you can get in for free which is saying more than a lot of other places that charge to watch the fight. The good thing about this place is they have plenty of parking as well as plenty of seating with two separate dining rooms and bars. ||| Worst service ever!  Waited 20 minutes for anyone to come to my table to offer anything!  Had 4 servers pass my table before 2 were walking past and we asked ""who is our server""...their response was ""let me find out""....watched them ask the hostess who kept looking at our table! When the server FINALLY came to our table, I told him we were leaving!  Will NEVER visit another Millers Ale House ever again!! ||| First and last time at this location.  Ordered our favorites, but my creole jambalaya had no chicken and my husband's meatloaf was in crumbles and a very small portion.  By the time my meal was fixed it arrived after my husband was finished eating. Just not a good experience. ||| Good service and food. Ran out of my beer but had plenty of others. Good location.  Surprised it wasn't more crowded. ||| I am brand new to Tampa. After 48 hrs of driving in a cramped car I was dreaming about a hot, fresh meal that didn't involve gas station food. We found Miller's by chance and boy am I glad I did!

I had Emily for a server. She was knowledgeable, attentive and gave great service. She recommended a great IPA and a ""make your own burger"" to match it. 

Though the restaurant was busy the service was fast and she brought our drinks right away to distract our grumbling bellies. All in all- what a great beginning to my move and I will definitely be back! ||| It's a nice atmosphere and the service was good for the most part. The good is TERRIBLE!! The worst sweet potato fries I have ever had.  The snowcrab legs were fishy and overcooked.  I couldn't even choke down a side of broccoli.   There are so many great places to eat in the area. Don't waste your time with gross good. Yuck!! ||| zingers with pepper lemon rub. It's ok but not as good as I have had at other places. Overall ambience is great and the place seems to be crowded mostly. Also tried the chicken hickory sandwich which was good provided you get hickory sauce on side , my taste preferences . ||| Terrible experience. I went in a group of 5 people and a child. Problem 1: Took 10/15 minutes to get a simple apple juice and water. Food comes out 20 minutes later, and my ossobuco is missing. They said it was dropped and another one was already being made. I completely understood. That wasnt the main dilemma. Problem 2: When they finally brought the new ossobuco to me, the middle bone was cold. Like, in a freezer cold. Waiter insisted she saw the cook make it. (Which is funny because later she tells me it was a cook IN TRAINING!! and wasn't sure if he thermometer checked it. Tell me how you watched him cook it again? and why was the trainee cooking food with what sounded like little to no experience?) They bring a 3rd one out, the boss supposedly made that one. My significant other who is a cook told me not to eat it. So I didn't. She had the baby back ribs. Biggest problem of all: I've been sitting in the ER with her since 5am due to food poisoning. She got sick over 10 times within an hour! She only ate 3 ribs and this is what happened! Her best friend who also ordered the ossobuco, and ate his, was stuck in his bathroom for over an hour. My significant others roommate also made a couple bathroom runs from another dish I don't remember. Thank god I didn't eat my food if not I'd be in a hospital bed next to my love. Only good thing that happened was them talking my food off the bill. Never going here again. ||| Do not pregame here for a Bucs game.  Waited at bar for 30 minutes and they only served about 5 people.  Apparently they did not realize there would be a crowd for the game tonight. ||| Hostesses seem less than thrilled to be there let alone seat me. While I was waiting for service, I look to see if there was Stevia packets in the sugar dish and there was a nasty onion looking thing on it that was not cleaned off. I sat there waiting for service and no one ever came so I decided to go sit at the bar Karma but when I got to the bar, the bar was dirty. I sat there for a little bit and the bartender never came to serve me. So I ended up just walking out. I miss the Palm Harbor Ale House that was in business years ago...their service was so much better than this location. ||| The outdoor bar is louder than a freight train when the TVS are tuned to sports. Either the young girl bartenders don't know how to pour beer, or there's something wrong with their taps because mine came out too frothy both times. At $6 a pop, I don't need  a 2 inch head on my draft.
Food looked standard barfood. Nothing sets it off from the stiff competition nearby such as Bar Louie,Taps, Duffy Tavern, Brickhouse...etc
I'll return, but slowly. ||| I usually don't leave reviews i been going to this place for 5 years now,but seriously last night was terrible the server was horrible she got everything wrong we order buffalo wings she gave us some honey type a steak well done for my sin she understood medium ask for ranch she gave us blue cheese,didn't even say sorry for the wait time and they didn't even cook the wings again they just put the buffalo sauce on top on the honey sauce that was it. 
Manager actitud wasn't the best but oh well. 
It's really sad this place its like this now it the second time this happen and that's why im leaving a review. ||| I love Miller's!  The selection of beers is phenomenal and the service is always genuinely nice.  I haven't had a bad meal or drink here. I highly recommend ||| Went to miller's last night and had twenty crispy wings and a Big Red. The problem wasn't really with the food but more the atmosphere. There was a man in the cooking area with his mask pulled around his neck and screaming at the top of his lungs. I don't know how comfortable I'd feel going back after this. 
It was a man on the far right of the cooking area wearing a red hat with a P on it. 
Not only is this unsafe for the people in that kitchen, as you know screaming intensifies COVID spread but how many meals did he also get germs on in the process. 

Nice Miller's. ||| Staying at a hotel close by, we asked for a quick bite to eat that could accommodate a large group. We were given 20% off meal cards and sent to Miller's. We don't have a Millers chain locally where we're from. 

They say us outside without asking if we want to sit outside in the humidity. In Tampa. In August. We had just left a baseball game and this is 1pm midday heat. There were tables available in ac but we weren't even given a choice. But we're starving. I went am got a portable fan out of the car and we just rolled with it. 

Two servers waited in our two tables of 7. The servers argued with each other and us. We had to beg for refills. Our food did come out astonishingly quickly, and it the orders were all right. Kudos for that.

The food was ok. Most didn't finish their food and we did all get to go but I ended up throwing my fish and chips away. It was super fishy but the batter was good. 

The bathrooms weren't clean nor the floors. It took 4. Ev. Er. To get our checks. Again the servers arguing about how to ring them up. 

I'm giving them two stars for the prompt food service as We were all hangry. And everyone else seemed to like their food even though I didnt. Sorry for no photos. It's a large group and we were talking baseball.

Everything else. I would only go back at night on a not so humid day unless I knew I could sit inside. ||| Wow! What a difference two visits make.  We went a year ago soon after this place had opened - great service and good food. Then, yesterday after a rough week we went in and proceeded to have the worst service ever! 

We arrived at around 6:00 and a manager took our name and said it was 15-30 minutes - not bad for a Saturday . As it was quite loud in the main dining area, the highlight of the evening was when a hostess, Liberty, asked if we would like to sit out on the patio.  As it was a nice day, and would be not as loud, we said yes, absolutely! Shortly thereafter we were sat.  That was the end of the good experience!

After sitting for 10-15 minutes unnoticed, our server (not telling us her name) finally came by and asked for our drink order. Once she brought the drinks, we placed our order. My girlfriend ordered the Zinger salad and asked for the dressing on the side.  I ordered the fish & chips which was to include fries and coleslaw. After quite a while, even for made from scratch food, our dinners were served by a food runner.  My girlfriend noticed there was no dressing - on the salad or on the side - and I asked for malt vinegar for my fish.  The food runner acknowledged our request and said he'd be right back.   After more than a few minutes our server, Brittani (I read her name tag, she never offered it) came by and asked how everything was.  We told her about the missing dressing and my request for malt vinegar.  She too said she'd be ""right back"".  After another 5-7 minutes, she came back with both.  By now, my fish had cooled to room temperature and my fries (which arrived lukewarm) were cold, Furthermore,although the menu had stated the dinner came with coleslaw, I realized I had not received any coleslaw.  Although my girlfriend finished her salad, my fish had become too cold to eat. When the manager stopped by and asked how things were, we explained the poor service and missing coleslaw.  He apologized and stated he would comp the bill. We asked for to-go boxes and the missing coleslaw.  When Brittani came back to the table, she placed the to-go boxes down and walked away.  No, ""I'm sorry"" or acknowledgement of the poor service...and STILL no coleslaw.  So, I walked up to the hostess stand, waited for the manager and told him Brittani had not brought the coleslaw.  He went back to the kitchen and returned with the coleslaw and a bag.

While anyone of these oversights in servvice might have been a minor annoyance, and not getting coleslaw may seem petty, most of all it was Brittani's lack of attention, responsibility or acknowledgement for ANY of it, made for a terrible experience. 

In closing, the one positive of the night was Liberty acknowledging us and offering to seat us on the patio.  Thanks, Liberty. ||| My first visit to this Miller's Ale House was just OK. We've enjoyed visiting the Carrollwood location for years, so I was looking forward to trying this one that's a little closer to home. Unfortunately, many months after opening, service is still lackluster. Maybe it's because they recently changed/updated their menu (according to our server - I didn't notice significant changes), but I was disappointed with our first visit here.

For starters, Miller's no longer offers beer flights. No biggie, I decided to stick with vodka & ordered Smirnoff with cranberry juice, for $2.95, per their All Day Happy Hour drink menu. I even pointed out what I wanted to our confused waitress while ordering (this was one of several times she referred to learning the new menu). Apparently that was not enough, however, as our bill reflected two Absolut cocktails for $4.95 each. When I pointed out the difference to our server, she seemed flustered (again) & said that's what I received. She took the bill away, but then sent someone else over to explain to us (?!) what I had ordered & what I was served. This gentleman was polite, yet insisted I'd been served Absolut. Not the point.. I reiterated that I had not ordered Absolut, but rather Smirnoff, and we wanted a credit. He relented & adjusted our bill, but the whole experience felt like a lot of effort for $4.

The food was good, but not memorable. Hubs ordered wings, which he enjoyed. I'd ordered the Zinger Mountain and it was noticeably not as hot as I'd expected a fresh pile of chicken & fries to be... as if the plate had sat under the heat lamp, waiting, until the wings were ready. In spite of that, it was tasty, and much more food than I could eat. 

This location is quite large, with a lot of comfortable outdoor seating. In early May, we did not feel hot at all sitting outside, under industrial ceiling fans. We also spotted a fire pit with seating, which was unexpected in this urban location facing Boy Scout Blvd. We'll probably return, since this Miller's is very convenient, but hopefully we'll get a server that's more knowledgeable of their specials. ||| Slowest food service I've ever had in a long time.  1:15 minute wait   
I'll never visit this location again! ||| Stopped in for a late lunch.  At at the bar and both wife and I ordered the flatbread and salad from the lunch menu.  $6.99 was a good deal.  Took awhile to get it but okay.  When it came the salad was good, but the flatbread was cold and chewy.  There was a postage sized stamp piece of meat on each of the six slices.   Lunch was cheap but not good.  It should be both or cheap doesnt matter. ||| This review should be 1 star but I had incredible service from Michael who did everything in his power to make this visit better. COVID has taken a toll on many businesses, I completely understand that but there should be full transparency on changes to the menu and up charges. Were the drinks also impacted? I always would get a mule and the one last night was pure sugar are we saving money on the liquor was put in drinks? The salad I always order went up in price and the quality was noticeably different I could barely eat it.  I ordered a mountain melt ($14.99) and added chicken to it I was used to it being $5 extra this time around it was $10 more.. if I had known this I would have ordered two but not even the waiter knew this and felt awful. It was 4 little pieces of chicken, nothing worth $10. Specials are no longer a thing here either so remember that if you are coming for that after 10pm. This place does not seem the same and it's unfortunate I used to love to come here to watch games. ||| Zingers (wings) were amazing to the point I went twice in 2 days.  Place gets packed for games, but there is still a good amount of room to be had.  Just watch out for the Capt Jack Buried Treasure, its totally addictive.  To the point I'm thinking of how good one would be right now. ||| Looking for last minute place to eat and saw millers.  I never been there but my friend has.  Got right in and shown to a booth in outdoor area.

Plenty of tvs to view on going games.  After ordering realized wasn't as hungry as initially felt.  The Mediterranean Flatbread filled me up....but just means took left overs home.

Overall, the place was not bad next time might sit up at bar area and enjoy a few more drinks with eating, watching games, and enjoying the over all atmosphere of place. ||| Love coming to this location!
Prior to COVID-19, we always opted to eat outside by the bar where it was covered. The fresh air is amazing! We still prefer to eat outside and was pleasantly surprised by how they have socially distanced the people and tables, I felt completely comfortable dining there!
All servers wore masks and were constantly cleaning- 5 stars for that alone! Our server was Mike- he was attentive, laid back, and had great customer service!

Last night was simply a cocktail night and we decided to order food to go, which never disappoints! We each had one of their amazing pitchers- Electric Blue Long Island and Margarita! The perfect size to just sit and talk for awhile! ($11.95 of goodness!)

We order a few things to go- The shrimp Cobb salad and Chicken Mexican Tacos. So good!

We visit this location about once a month so if you're in the area, definitely go in and enjoy! ||| Wow zingers are terrible!  1st and last time at a Millers.  The food was not good.  The service was even worse.  If I were looking for a place to eat I would keep looking.  After we sat down we sat the waitress 2 more times with long periods of time between visits.  The food is below average. ||| Definitely not a fan. A friend and I sat at the bar for lunch thinking we would get faster service. It took 15 minutes for the bartender to come over and take our drink orders. After waiting another long amount of time she was ready to take our food order. My friend got the fish, shrimp and clam combo and I got a burger medium. His food came out without the fish and my medium was still practically bleeding. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Stay away unless you like paying for food you don't get or undercooked beef. ||| So I've been coming to Miller's Ale houses for over 21 years. Today I ordered the same thing I always get. The spinach dip. It's usually a good amount and it's baked in the oven with cheese over it. Well I got mine and it was about 1/4 cup of spinach dip put into a bowl and microwaved with no cheese. Part of it was burnt to the bottom and I was not able to eat. Their food is definitely not the standard the the previous (Miller family) owners held.  Sad that they have to cut back quality and portions to try and make it during this difficult time. Service is still good, but without a good quality food, service doesn't matter. ||| Had a great dinner last night. The fried shrimp were phenomenal and our waiter, Robert was AWESOME!  He was so patient, friendly and efficient. Nothing we asked of him threw him and he always had a smile on his face. He really made our evening extra special. I am looking forward to going back soon and hopefully, Robert will be working that night!  Great restaurant, great atmosphere, great food and awesome staff!  Who could ask for more???? ||| After walking the Miller's walk (walkable distance from my work) I tried out lunch twice at this new Miller's location. It is nicely located on grady and west boy scout boulevard.
 It's quite impressive how they have been handling the orders quickly even during busy lunch hours. I won't say that the food is excellent, but its quite good and filling. The portions are perfect for lunch and not as expensive as the bars and restaurants in this area.  
In appetizers I've tried calamari which wasn't the best that I've had but definitely quite good.  We also got the ale house combo which had potato skins, onion rings, fried mozzarella with nacho chips. For lunch so far I really like their big red which has a big size juicy buffalo chicken breast fried lightly. I also tried the meatloaf which was quite good and filling as well. ||| We originally only came for drinks. Two of our ten guests ordered food. No problem with the food. Manager took care of us initially. However, server was great. Manager became upset when we asked about alcohol content in the margarita pitcher...Then he became ghost. Really?? We were surprised...really surprised. We thought he started out well and then when he received a negative comment from him... not cool. He could have done better considering the clientele. Especially from a table of past servers...we were not that bad. Thankfully we didn't mind and ordered our drinks differently. So to the staff...thank your manager for the three stars. Otherwise, it was great! ||| Great place to eat, drink and have fun! We can always see our favorite games and can always count on quality food and service! Never disappointed! ||| This review is based off of the service received, not the food. 

Our server Brittany kind of sucked. She was actually terrible! She didn't offer to refill our drinks, or even check on us after we got our food. She didn't even have common sense to clear out the table after we were done. She got upset and threw my check on the table, but handed my friends their checks. I guess she didn't like the fact that I had to clear the plates that were cluttered around the table and placed them on the one next to us. Oh well.. Brittany.. get it together! ||| Was in the area today and saw they were open now (last time I drove by they were still building) so I decided to stop in and I was glad I did! Love the decor and aesthetic in here - yes there are other sports bar type places right up the street in either direction. But I would say that the food here is better than those alternatives. Had the zingers which were really good - someone walking by on the way to their table stopped to asked me what I was eating because they wanted to order it too LOL. The server was super nice - friendly, efficient, and on top of things. And this is not something I usually comment on but the restrooms were the nicest and cleanest I think I've ever seen in an restaurant of this type. Will definitely come back here and recommend to others. Oh and if you have been thinking about it...get the cheese fries. They are amazing. :) ||| Soo you can get me in anywhere if the drink specials are amazing ! The Mojitos are $5 and at a certain hour even the sangria is like $3.95. Super friendly staff, wide range of seating. From outside to inside to bar and patio. Love this business out in Orlando so we're are so stocked to have them here in Tampa ! Try the zingers you will not regret it ||| Had the shrimp scampi and it was pretty bland. I was really expecting a better beer selection but it was just the normal restaurant line up. ||| They have daily lunch specials.  Get your lunch quickly, so you can relax for lunch. Tried the prime roast sandwich, not a daily special but worth it. ||| Management did a fantastic job of hiring the staff here. Friendly and helpful with absolutely no attitude. Plus, tons of tv's and great food and drink specials-no complaints here. ||| Went to millers ale house by the airport and stopped by the outside patio bar. Was greeted immediately by Lindsey. Lindsey was on point with service, offering my friend and I the specials and doing it with a smile. She was fast and we never waited for anything. I highly suggest going to this specific location! The manager on duty was Mike. He stopped by to see how we were doing and introduced himself. The drinks tasted great and service was awesome. I will definitely be back !!! ||| My husband had I were looking forward to having the rib special they offer on Monday nights.  We have always enjoyed them and the price. We haven't been in awhile and we went tonight.  The price is still good but the quality wasn't like they have been in the past.  They were smaller and less meatier. The baked potatoes used to be good size but small tonight.  My ribs were over done to the point they were dry and I  had burnt areas which wasn't pleasant tasting. The waitress never asked how our food was. We ordered double butter for the potatoes and didn't get. When my husband asked her for more she just brought one butter. Potatoes were dry. We use to love the bake potatoes there. 
When I was able to get her attention again I let her know the ribs were on the overdone side and dry and asked for bbq sauce to put on, she didn't even care and walked away and came back with the bbq and dropped it off. The server wasn't attentive. It was a disappointing night. We were not satisfied.  


Went back again tonight with 7 others to have the rib special.  They raised the price to 14.99 and one side.  We who ordered the broccoli got 5 small florets of broccoli and the coleslaw wasn't given with two of the meals and the ones who received the coleslaw it's smaller and was dry.   The ribs were good.  It's just not the same as it use to be.  Disappointing after waiting so long to go again and to be disappointed again. ||| Came to Tampa for vacation for a few days. Stopped in after a lightning game and this was the worst experience I've ever had at any ale house in the country. From the time we sat down to the time we left. After waiting 15 minutes to be greeted and watching the server who was supposed to take care of us sit there and roll silverware the whole time, we got up and moved  to the bar. Took about 5 minutes to even see a bartender come behind the bar( there were 2 working).  Drinks were ok. Half our pot stickers were not cooked all the way. The meatloaf was cold upon arrival sent it back and when it came out the second time it was still cold and saltier than the sea. Not to mention we watched the cook place the whole plate in the microwave and giving the bartender attitude   for having to fix it. Burger was over cooked. Watched the girl working the take out orders scratch her head repeatedly while touching and boxing up food. The staff was not friendly nor attentive to any of the guests. It was like watching a bunch zombies walk around a restaurant. Managers were more worried about watching football and sitting with their family to make sure the establishment was being ran correctly. Needless to say my next trip to Tampa we will not be visiting again. ||| After being told it was 25-30 min wait. We waited 1 hr and 15 min. Then they sat us outside. This place is terrible and the hostess' were clueless beyond belief. Will never eat here again. If I could select zero stars I would've. ||| My fiancé and I went on a date to a play at the Straz Theatre tonight. Afterwards, we met some friends near armature works to hang out for a little bit and started heading home. We had not eaten and we were really hungry. Come to find out, there's not many places open at 11:30 at night. We quickly yelped places around the area and found that Miller's Ale House was open until 2pm. We quickly re-routed and arrived about 15 minutes till midnight. The hostess told us, ""I think the kitchen closes at 11:30, let me go check."" She came back and quietly said, ""kitchen closes at 12."" We still thought the place closed at 2am and were both very confused. We were directed to a table near the kitchen where our server greeted us and said, ""Hi guys, you know the kitchen closes in 15 minutes right?"" We did not feel very welcomed and felt rushed. I used to work at Chili's and we would accept people, full menu all the way until close and never made them feel like a burden to our store. 
I ordered the Zingers salad with grilled zingers in medium sauce with balsamic dressing. I couldn't taste the sauce on the zingers and the salad overall was just pretty plain, but okay I guess. My fiancé ordered the prime rib and it wasn't really what he was expecting. It was cold, but had some flavor. 
In the middle of us eating, they turned all the high lights on and it blinded us. They couldn't patiently wait for us to finish our food before doing that. We finished quickly and asked the server at the end what time they close and he told us, we close at 12 on the weekdays. 
My recommendation would be to update the closing time on yelp and google, because it says they close at 2am on a Thursday night. ||| This location is perfect for any occasion. We love meeting there for lunch with my wife, meeting friends and coworkers for happy hour, and also to catch the UFC fights. All the staff is great but, Guillermo is our favorite waiter he's awesome. The Pot Stickers are amazing, and so are their salads, and wings. Honestly never had anything we didn't like! ||| Great ""outdoor"" seating area that totally covered and air conditioned but very cool for happy hours after work. Large menu with something good for everyone. I have been happy w my meals every time and the prices are pretty decent for what you get. Not my favorite restaurant in the world but definitely worth a try, esp w a group. ||| Good food and appetizers. Great beer.  The prices are reasonable.  Not a lot of parking. We had to circle the parking lot and wait on someone who was leaving. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the food.  She made suggestions. ||| I'm so happy they opened a millers in the area. Very cool outdoor bar and the inside is nice too.  Really enjoyed the new flatbreads. ||| Miller's Ale House has opened a new sports bar near the Tampa Airport and International Plaza, along Columbus Drive, and just to the east of Dale Mabry Highway. This particular section of town is now super-saturated with sports bars with Lee Roy Selmon's, Brick House Tavern, and the newly-opened Duffy's Sports Grill all within a stone's throw.

This location of Miller's has the same menu as their site in Carrollwood near Bearss Avenue and Dale Mabry. This stand-along building is nearly twice the size with a big indoor restaurant, a massive covered outdoor patio bar, and some covered outdoor seating near the fire pit. One of the staff said to me, Sure, we're dog-friendly, but he'll have to sit outside near the fire pit, and some of our bar patrons might decide to cook him, but go right ahead.....  

I knew that I liked this place!  : - )

Miller's has two large bars within the restaurant. One is inside in the main restaurant, and the other is outside under the covered patio. In addition to both being full liquor bars, they have a vast selection of craft beers and brews on tap.

The menu has the same collection of bar appetizers, featuring Zingers which are their fresh, never-frozen, hand-breaded boneless chicken wings tossed in your choice of sauce from easy-going to insane. You'll see a lot of the standard bar appetizers including nachos, smoked fish dip, fried mozzarella and chips, to name a few. They also have soups and entrée salads, flatbreads, build-your-own burgers, sandwiches, fajitas, and some lighter entrée options. 

House favorites include ribs, jambalaya, osso buco pork shank, pastas, steaks, seafood, and fish entrées. My go-to entrée on the menu is the 35 shrimp, which you can order fried, grilled, blackened, or as alfredo or scampi. I usually add a crock of their excellent French onion soup, a side salad, along with that big ole honkin platter of shrimp. There's no room for dessert after all of that, but Miller's does have a full dessert menu with ice cream cakes, hot fudge sundaes, and an apple crisp.

The food is terrific, and the energy of the servers is infectious. I am sure that this new location of Miller's Ale House will do quite well, but they clearly have a lot of competition in the area for those who want to drink beer, and sit and watch sporting events on TV.

Give them a try for lunch, Happy Hour, or dinner. ||| Great place to watch NFL football. Would love to see more beer specials but overall a great atmosphere. And, the wings are pretty good. ||| I am amending my review. We had a bad experience in service recently (just service, food was delicious as always). Within the same day of posting the review, the manager contacted me, both through phone and email to follow up. He listened to the concerns and certainly maintained our business as the level of customer service the manager alone showed in response to our issues was above what you see these days.

I am not normally a fan of chicken on nachos, but the way they marinate the chicken is delicious, so definently recommend the chicken nachos (side note, you'll need to share, they are huge!) And the pot stickers are great appetizers. You can't leave without fulfilling that sweet tooth craving with the captain jacks. We will often go just for this! ||| Lissette is the best waitress there!¡! She's such a sweet and genuine person. Making us laugh while being so innocently funny plus they have good food with great drink specials ||| We ate at Ale House on Thursday. I am celiac and explained to the server that I could not have wheat products.  After having to explain to him that deep frying doesn't kill the gluten (seriously?!) I ordered a salad and was clear to say no croutons. 

Later that night I started to feel ill, I went to bed hoping it would go away. The next day I woke up and had sharp stomach cramps and signs of cross contamination.  I am still feeling the effects of the cross contamination. I suspect either they used a utensil that was used with an item containing wheat or the server put croutons on the salad and remembered I couldn't have them and took them off.   

These restaurants really need to educated their employees on food allergies. ||| This place is simply awesome!  We were there with friends and family. Great kids meal choices (and found out kids eat free on Tuesdays). We had the famous zingers, which are fresh breaded chicken tossed in your favorite wing sauce.  The baby back ribs were fall off the bone and you've got to try the Captain Jacks dessert.  Wow!  Great for sports, looks to have over 50 tvs along with 2 full bars and lots of local beers on tap. They have both and inside and outside area.  The service was friendly and amazing as well!  We'll definitely be back! ||| I've been seeing Miller's opening all over the area.  I didn't know they are sports bars. I'm loving the 60+ tv's, indoor and outdoor seating and great menu variety. ||| Got out of work early and decided to try the new Miller's Ale House. The Fish Dip appetizer was actually pretty good. Would definitely order it again. The Fish n Chips entree didn't fare as well. The batter on the fish was tasty but was a bit doughy in places. The fries were stale and the entire entree was cold. As for being a party of just one the server was very attentive, not something I always get dining alone. Her only fault was that both my appetizer and entree were served at the same time. Even with these issues I would be more than willing to give them another try, perhaps for dinner instead. ||| I understand that we are in a pandemic but this was just an overall bad experience. I ordered a chicken philly & fries via Uber eats. I received a bag with no napkins, no ketchup, and my sandwich was too salty to eat. ||| Chicken Cheesesteak. I'm in love. You have to try it. I don't add the peppers and mushrooms but do get extra cheese. Paired with fresh fries and ranch make me want to dance. Or it's the Reef Donkey - get one of those too. Then order a Chicken Cheesesteak togo, because why not? Go get one now, you will not be upset! ||| I absolutely love this place I live 20 minutes away but will drive out of my way to come to this location . We always have wonderful food wonderful service and great drink specials By I definitely want to recognize the bartender Emily . She is simply amazing always has a smile on her face and attentive to all of your customers .  She is one of the main reasons I keep coming back .  Keep up the great work alehouse ! ||| In town for an Illini football game. The staff accommodated our rather large fan base that arrived. In particularly, Vanessa was amazing! We really couldn't have asked for a kinder, well versed, kind young lady. Highly recommend this place! ||| Really really bad service. Took them roughly 45 minutes to even get us water and another 45 minutes for food. 
This after we approached the server and asked for water. Unbelievable. ||| Been there few times, nice space, big screens, good happy hour, pretty bad food.. we got few appetizers and two steaks. Everything was just heavy and flavorless. I would go back for drinks but not for dinner. Friendly service ||| Service was very slow. The server was friendly but overwhelmed by our large group and no one helped her. Staff need better customer service training. Even the manager lacked tact in his actions and attempted to take my drink when I put it in a to go cup. First off the straw is bigger and I don't have to stop and refill. ||| This place seems to be a hit or miss. Tonight was a bit of a miss. Started with the Fiesta Nachos. Came out quick enough that I was surprised at the number of soggy chips I found. Aside from the sog it was delicious. Entree was the Fish n Chips. The fish was tasty and decently fried. The fries however left a bit to be desired. Some seemed stale while others didn't seem completely cooked. Flavor wise they were seasoned well. My compliments to my waitress. As a single diner I'm, unfortunately, used to being slighted but Maria (??) was very attentive. She even made sure to hold off on my entree order so I could enjoy my nachos. Kudos for that. There seems to be a trend at some restaurants to have everything come out at nearly the same time. All and all I'll probably still eat here occasionally as it is on my way home from work. ||| You have a waitress that works there named Tiffany that is rude to handicapped children and handles food in an unsanitary manner. Why would you continue to employ someone like that? Will never step foot in again. ||| Miller's Ale House is a nice addition to the Westshore area.  Only three weeks old, I stopped in for lunch and found a comfy seat at the bar. I contemplated checking out the covered outdoor bar but they have tons of really awesome misters above and my curly hair wouldn't enjoy the frizziness that would follow.  Nice concept but I did notice mostly guys seated out there lol.

They have tons of specials pretty much all day. They differ from afternoon to evening but there's lots to choose from. See pictures attached to my review.  

Typical bar fare BUT with an added flair.  I enjoyed my grilled chicken salad and asked to have my chicken tenders tossed in HOT sauce.  I was charged an additional .50 but understandable I guess.  

Nice atmosphere, pleasing staff and good food...what's not to like?? ||| Came here for lunch and had a great experience!  Can't wait to come back for football season!  Jullian was a fantastic server, food was excellent and ambiance on par.  Will be back for sure! ||| This place seems to be a hit or miss. Tonight was a bit of a miss. Started with the Fiesta Nachos. Came out quick enough that I was surprised at the number of soggy chips I found. Aside from the sog it was delicious. Entree was the Fish n Chips. The fish was tasty and decently fried.

There seems to be a trend at some restaurants to have everything come out at nearly the same time. All and all I'll probably still eat here occasionally as it is on my way home from work.

Tonight did not start out well. Was seated in an empty section. Had to wait ten minutes before a server noticed me. His excuse... ""well an employee had been sitting here""... as far as I could tell the table had not been sat at. 
Ordered the fish dip only to be told they were out of the crackers. Ended up ordering the more expensive spinach dip. ||| I love the outdoor bar and lounge area.  It's really neat that establishments have some other seating besides inside only. The drinks prices are actually decent and should I even say cheap during happy hour and late night happy hour. I'm talking 4 dollar Ketel drinks and other premium brands. The food is ok, the mozzarella sticks are really bad they should think about that menu item and revise it. The flatbreads are decent, I enjoyed the zinger flatbread with buffalo sauce over the flatbread. Overall this is a great place to enjoy drinks and appetizers while watching a game. ||| Made a reservation for 12:30, arrived early and was seated okay. We ordered our food at 12:25 and at 1:25, we were just getting served. One hour to wait is ridiculous during the lunch time. The took their time with us because they knew they were getting a tip because of the size of our party.

I want up and asked at 1:15 what was the deal with our food and I was told they had some people call out, not my problem. They said it was ready but they were preparing and it would be another 10 minutes? Oddly enough we had people who ordered steak and got their food before me. I had to wait 10 minutes after everyone was served to get my food, a Ceaser Salad, that is unacceptable.

Not some where we will return too ||| I go to Miller's Ale House at least once a week. They have daily specials and menu with many choices. I would rate the food very good and also the service. My main server is Guillermo. I ask for him mainly because when I am seated he automatically brings my favorite drink within minutes. He always has a smile. It's very important to have staff that recognizes  the customer and their needs. ||| I really liked the design of this location-indoor outdoor field and tons of TVs. Great service ||| I ate here multiple times and it never disappoints! The staff and food was really good. I have nothing bad to say really. I usually get the ribeye which is great and is on special during the week. I will continue to patron Millers! ||| Come here all the time food and service is always great but my girlfriend and I came in on june 6th for dinner and our waiter justin was the best waiter ive ever had by far gonna try to sit in his section from now on. keep it goin Millers! ||| Great sangaria.Bar service great. Lots of sports fans here especially after the Bucs game. Appetizer are great ||| Great sports bar with cold beer and terrific drinks selection.  They have great service (sat at the bar and was well taken care of by Matt and Que).  Lots of TVs and great happy hour crowd!

Unfortunately food sucked.  Got guac and chips and blackened chicken quesadilla.  Guac looked and tasted like it came out of a large Sysco can.  Sour cream tasted a little tangy like it was past expiration.  Rice & beans sides were dry and clumped together like middle school cafeteria grub.  Salsa also completely blew goats.  Finally, the chicken in the quesadilla was like slightly thick cut deli meat folded over.  What a JOKE!  Complete bummer because everything else was great.  Step up the grub game guys!!! ||| Food is great.


Service may be the worst I've ever had. Everyone ran out of drinks. Ask for additional items that never came out. I got up and went to the bar to get malt vinegar for one of the guys, then had to find my own bottle of ketchup. Natalie A. 


Atmosphere is great. 

Maybe she was having a bad night. ||| Manager was sweet, but waitress was a little inattentive, we asked three times for grandmas fried to be well done. They came out not well done and they said they would come out corrected but never did. Food was bleh. Nothing special. ||| Great service, a little bit busy waiting time 45 minutes to get a table, if you are not sit on the bar you are not allowed to get a drink, anyway the bartenders were nice enough, by the time they call us to let us know they have available table for us, we was heading to the parking lot.  Let's consider they are close to the Raymond James Stadium, football  season ‍ ||| Love the location? Love the outdoor seating and drink specials, but the food is just ok. With covid it's all about outdoor seating and plenty of ventilated spaces. This place marks allot of that off.  Our service was good and the place was clean. Lots of tv's and seems to be a perfect place to watch a sports game. Sadly, the wings aren't as good as other sports bars. ||| Cool new place!

Lots of beers on tap and even had vegan options for food which is super weird for a sports bar. They have a family friendly section that is behind glass and two bars. The patio has all modern furniture and it's just a really attractive place. 

The bartenders look like they are a bit new so they were a bit scattered with service but we were always taken care of by someone in a decent amount of time! The specials they have on drinks (even whiskey!) are unbelievable.

Nothing bad to say, this place rocks and is a great new addition to the area. ||| Best place to bring a crowd of friends! It's a real chill place with a fire pit? Jen was great with memorizing my drinks and showing us a good time! ||| Well let's start off by saying the first time we went there we had an excellent server! 
So we decided to go back a second time - so sad to say the service sucked so bad 
The young lady who waited on us was very nice - no sense of urgency - took forever to get a beer at our table - I had asked for extra cheese for my Ceasar salad - brought when I was half way finished - also I asked for grilled chicken in my salad - got jerk chicken - 
My other half wanted a side of honey mustard - she brought ceasar dressing - one of the worst servers I have come across - it's really sad how we get excellent service the first time snd not even sub par service the next! 
Needless to say very disappointed 2stars is being very generous ||| Good start. Had a trainee waitress. She left halfway through our stay. Had a manager take care of us after. We got our food and all of it was freezing cold. The fajitas were burnt to a char. The fries were rock hard and cold. We were watching it sit in the window for over 5 minutes. We sent back our Mac and cheese with the zingers and we still waited for over 30 minutes for a remake. They brought it back out and still screwed it up. Inedible. We waited another 15 minutes until someone even walked by our table. It was a manager and we stopped him letting him know that the meal we waited over and hour and a half for was wrong again. We asked for it to just be taken off the bill seeing as I didn't wanna take another chance. The staff avoided our table after us sending back our 1st meal, we asked for our checks after we got our food. We saw the management shake their heads and look at us. Obviously talking about us. After that we had a different team of ""management"" come to our table to drop off checks. By the way, took 25 minutes to drop off our checks. They were just rude and nasty. Will never come back. Will never recommend. Bad management. This place has gone downhill. ||| Horrible service, no attention to detail, wrong order, too busy to give two sh*ts, classic example of being understaffed and overcrowded... ZERO stars! ||| Great place! I had a nice lunch that was a great value. I super enjoyed the beer selection and it paired well with the meatloaf and broccoli that were perfectly cooked.  Ask for Vanessa at the bar. Super service from the tender of the bar. ||| Terrible food out of the kitchen. Non existent management staff. Main/ only reason to go to this restaurant is cheap drinks from the bar. 

I didn't expect gourmet food. But I did expect edible food made correctly. But oh well. 

Lots of sports bars in this area now. Choose wisely... ||| Service has been good both times I was there.  Food was good, and really did well with the group of Kentucky fans.

Drinks were also priced very well ||| good food, terrible service. the hostesses are bitchy & socialize and can't even sit you because there to damn busy talking. They wont sit you inside when there numerous tables open because theres a wait. If you want good service go to the Ale House on Fowler. ||| I came in last night with a couple of my friends. We had Mike as our server and he was great! He was very friendly and nice to chat with!! 

I was not a huge fan of the Chicken Parmesan- the chicken was pretty good but the fettuccine alfredo tasted soapy. The chicken alfredo on the menu is one of my favorite dishes so I was surprised by the change in taste. 

The potstickers were amazing! I have never had them but I will definitely be ordering them again! 

I absolutely loved the nachos. The queso was perfect! 

Overall, I had a great experience at this location and I definitely plan on returning. ||| Super bad attention in this place, they took a long time to deliver my food and they delivered it incomplete I had to cancel the order since they took longer than it should, they delivered my food and my daughters' never arrived.  I will not go to this place again ||| Need to update menu for plant based food.
Impossible burger or Beyond Meat burger would have me And many others choosing Ale House over others that have moved to new menu items already. ||| Had a Friday afternoon company function here. The servers were great and prompt. The appetizers were ok. The mozzarella was a little cold, that is to be expected in a buffet setting that is partly outdoors. The spinach dip and chips was great. Enjoyed part of the bar being outdoors with good seating. ||| We're visiting Tampa from out of state, and the manager at our hotel recommended Miller's. 

He didn't steer us wrong! Keeshawn, our server, was attentive and warmly professional. Even if the Mediterranean Flatbread and Steak Salad hadn't been the perfect choices, we'd still recommended Miller's for Keeshawn's hospitality. ||| HUGE space. Lots of seats and open feeling. Big bar with lots of draft and liquor options! whoop whoop now it's a party!
Had a really good chicken salad that was recommended by my waiter. Tried the Osso bucco too and that is well worth the visit alone! Prices are great and you get a lot of food as well.. like enough to take home and eat as a snack later.. if you're that kind of person....Wish they didn't close the other one on Dale Mabry but this one is close to work so it's all good! ||| The regional/ district manager cursed my friends and I out for sitting in the ""sanitation station"" telling us ""how about you get the fuck out"" then proceeded to follow us to the parking lot telling us ""get off the fucking property"". Then proceeded to call the cops because we were waiting on an Uber in the parking lot. Terrible person and the server even decided to tell us that ""he's a dick"". ||| Four stars for taking good care of me and +15 coworkers seated outdoors. We got there at 11am (right when they open) & it made a difference with no crowd. They did a good job getting our drinks & food out in a timely fashion.

I loove a sparkly, an extra fizzy prosecco, which you get a miniaturize bottle and top off yourself, so drink at your leisure. I also decided on a beer with similar taste to Guinness, but crafted locally, so I got Coppertail Stout & always love the deep, coffee-like taste that's quite yummy.

I got their flat iron steak salad 3.5/5 with dressing on the side because I don't like it drenched, which wilts the lettuce. I stole a bite of steak (more tender than my flat iron & secretly envied the whole time) & chicken fajitas 4/5 & would get that instead.

One of my coworker's brought his own set of jenga, which was a fun setup because we had a great time playing while enjoying cool breezes. ||| The food quality has gone down significantly.  I still really like this place go just come grab a beer. Staff is great and prices are good. ||| The inside I the restaurant has a good ambiance. The prices weren't bad, but I didn't see much on the menu I liked. I ordered a flat bread and it was okay. ||| Not impressed. The service was slow for my first visit. On my second visit my boyfriend and I stopped in to get a beer on our way home. We stood at the bar area for over 10 minutes while the bartender ignored us, so we ended up leaving.",204,279,150652,97.58999999999999
171258,"I was invited to a birthday party there.  They had a private room with a hostess.  There were ice cream chocolate chip cookie as the birthday treat.  They had a piñata was simple with string for all the kids to participate.

As for the games, the card was a quarter and many of the games were worth 30 cents.  Some of the games were similar to D&B but I enjoyed the unique skee ball game.  It is great that they also had available bowling, 1/2 round of mini golf, laser tag, bumper cars and speed racing.  The laser tag was fun because you would know which team won and their points.  However, it was hot in that room.  The bumper cars were OK with 3 people but if their other car worked it would have been more fun.  The prizes were good to redeem the game tickets for.

The buffet was bigger than I expected.  Not longer did they have a variety of pizzas, they had a salad bar, lots of desserts like cinnamon roll, soft serve ice cream, pies, etc., taco bar, chicken fingers, hot dogs, mac & cheese, and help-yourself soda fountain.  I enjoyed the buffet! ||| We've been to The Incredible Pizza Company a number of times.  For those of you who don't know, it's a lot like a Dave and Buster's (or Jillian's), but without the alcohol and WITH a monster (unlimited) buffet.  I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about the food.  Some people think it's great, some people say it's terrible.  Personally, I've experienced both sides of this..  and I honestly think it depends on the time of day that you are there.  

At night, when they are super busy, the food is hot and fresh and constantly being refilled.  But during the day, when the place is basically empty, the food isn't turned over as often, and can get dry, etc.  But this isn't REALLY a problem, because they will make any pizza (to order) in like 8 minutes.  Plus! Their pizza is pretty good, and they have lots of other options, including tacos, chicken, an extensive salad bar area, and pasta.  Their garlic cheese bread is EXTRA tasty, as is their Hawaiian pizza.  They also have dessert pizza, cookies, brownies, ice cream, etc...  For after your meal.  

They are also always running amazing specials.  The one my husband get in on most often is the Buffet + 20 dollar game card for 19.99.  Yes folks. That's a FREE unlimited buffet. So, for FREE... the food is pretty amazing.  (They also have a 12 dollar game card and buffet for 12.99, if you don't want to play AS much.)

Then. After that! Games! There are a lot of standard video games, but of course my favorites are the skill based games that reward your efforts with tickets...  Skeeball is awesome, after all!  Everything is card based, and you can register your card and save your tickets over time...  (This also means that if you lose your card, or it becomes de-magnetized, you can get it replaced.)  The prizes that are available for redemption are a little bit lame, but I suppose I might be jaded by spending a few summers on the Jersey shore.

We actually recently moved back, and we decided to treat all our friends to a party at Incredible Pizza.  The party packs are a bit pricey, but it ended up being completely worth it.  We got there at 3 in the afternoon, and ended up staying until close (a full 8 hours).  Everyone got to play tons of video games (we got the unlimited game package), and we all ate two meals there that day. We also got unlimited drinks, so we'd play a bit, and go get a beverage, and then play some more.  We had an INCREDIBLE time!  :)  

The only negatives that I can see is that when it's busy, you might have to wait a bit to play certain games...  and sometimes people don't seem to recognise that there is a LINE behind them...  and that taking turns is good.  But that's more a gripe with people than the establishment itself.

Oh!  And the game play is half off during the day!  So if you are every playing hookey from work, you should hit up The Incredible Pizza Company!

** I just want to note that my fellow reviewer is mistaken when he says that you have to buy game credits to eat the buffet. You can purchase the buffet for under 5 dollars and just eat the food without playing any games. You may also play the games without purchasing any food. ||| The food here is actually pretty decent for essentially a kids' pizza buffet.  There are several options besides pizza (biscuits & gravy, pastas, chicken fingers, mashed potatoes & gravy, corn, green beans, chili dogs, tacos, etc.).   As expected, the soup and salad selection is pretty wan while the dessert selection is sprawling. ||| This is like a larger Chuck E Cheese's. Thank God I had two Groupons, because it would have been super expensive. 
The good: 1. My nieces loved the go karts-the older one (7) got to drive her own. They have two speeds-slow or fast. The younger one (4) and I also rode double (I drove) in a slow one. I think you have to be 48"" tall to drive your own. Not sure of how tall for the fast ones. 2. Good game selection. Also had bumper cars and a few other small ""ride"" type things and laser tag. 3. Lots of seating.  4. It was a good 2.5 hours of entertainment. 

The bad: 1. The food. Not of the best quality. The buffet is mostly pizza and pasta. There was a separate salad bar and dessert bar. 2. Expensive. I had two groupons that equaled $50. This paid for our food and plenty of time for playing games (but this was only for two kids). HOWEVER, the bumper cars and go karts, etc, cost more money. HOWEVER, I accidently didn't pay for the go-karts. Seriously accidental. I didn't see the thing to swipe your card-no staff member was standing there. I honestly thought we would swipe it just before we got on. Nope. I got a $15 freeby. Oopsie. 3. The people sitting outside smoking. The benches were lined with older people, who obviously were not there with children(Mostly elderly),  who had apparently partaken (is that a word?) of the $9.99 ""All You Can Eat"" buffet. It was wonderful to think that all the kids entering were walking through their cloud of smoke.  4. The type of clientele. I found many people to be rude. Mostly in the dining room. The dining room is set up with rooms in themes, and lots of people have birthday parties there. At one point, some people saw me standing there trying to get through-they were between tables standing up and talking, and I had to walk around to get to my nieces. Like go out, walk around the whole room and come in another entrance. Also lots of kids running. 

In the medium category: 1. Lots of staff people. I saw multiple people going by with mop buckets. I kept wondering if there were that many kids vomitting or what. Also, I instructed the elder niece to sit at the table while I took her sister to the restroom. Of course, she is 7 and can't follow those types of instructions. I come out of the bathroom and she is getting another plate of food. We go back to the table, and it is all bussed away. Everything. I was a bit bitter about my salad, but I guess with it being mostly kid clientele, there are used to lots of food getting wasted, and probably thought we were done. We had literally just sat down. 



In conclusion, go if you have a groupon. I don't think I could afford to go if I did not. And yes, I realize that it is expected that lots of kids will be there, but I also expect manners out of kids, regardless of where they are. Oh, and out of adults too. ||| Everything is coated in a thin layer if dirt. The prices are high compared to some of the local competitors.  Overall the staff seems helpful and answered any questions I had, which were many, as this was my first time here.  I would advise caution with the buffet as I saw a lot of kids helping themselves, some were more hygienic than others. ||| I just dont get the bad reviews on this place. If we are going to compare this place to Chuck E Cheese, then lets do so. This place is to Chuck E Cheese what Outback Steakhouse is to Ruth's Chris. There simply is no comparision in my opinion. My wife and I took the kids to Indianapolis to celebrate my sons 8th birthday. We went on a Monday (which is kids day so its $7 for him to eat unlimited food...mainly pizza for an 8 year old) and he gets $5 worth of games for that $7....are ya kidding me? Our 3 year old ate free and since it was my sons birthday, he got to spin the prize wheel which offered the birthday boy all types of stuff. He spinned the wheel and he got a free go cart ride (which was great, because that is exactly what he wanted). We got our choice of 4 themed rooms to sit in and our birthday boy picked the diner (even though the movie theater looked really cool). Adults are $7.99 which isnt super cheap, but not really expensive either. Pizza and cheesy bread were on par with Chuck E Cheese, if not a bit better. Their meat loaf was ok and the rest of the buffet was blah at best, but honestly what do you truly expect? The place was very clean, the staff was very friendly, the go karts were fun, the game selection was great and take it from someone who almost wanted to perform a do it yourself vasectomy at Chuck E Cheese, this place BLOWS IT AWAY! Its a shame there isnt one by where we live, because I know the kids would want to go often and unlike Chuck E Cheese or Cici's....we wouldn't mind taking them. ||| I bought a groupon for a 4 person buffet and a $25 game card. The games are incredibly expensive. I've been there 2 times before. Everything has gone up. The 'token' games that are there.... $1.25 gets you 4 tokens. Stick with chuck e cheese, food is just as bad, games are half the price. ||| A favorite of the tiny humans!

Hard to go wrong with cheap pizza and games. Never too early to teach your children how to gamble.

 Don't go here expecting good food just mountains of it. ||| I could sum up our trip to Incredibles Pizza Company with four simple words.  WILL NOT GO BACK.  

If you know anything about this chain, you're thinking it's a lot like a cross between Chuck E Cheese and CiCi's Pizza.  You'd be right when it comes to the quality/selection of food and access to games.  However, the experience will turn off anyone who has to pay for it.  

Simply put the hook is the ""$0.99"" buffett. But it comes at a major price.  You're forced to buy a card with game credits.  I was ok with that until you see how much the games cost inside the IPC.  Minibowling is $3.50 for 5 frames.  I can get 7 games of real bowling at our local alley for the same price as a 10 frame here.  No games are under $1.  The ticket wheel and crane are $3 each.  Neither last more than 15 seconds.

If you have to pay.  Stay away.  If you're on someone else's nickel, enjoy the experience and remember to go somewhere else when it's your turn. ||| I want to begin with the positive: hanging out with my family. We enjoyed dodging the laser beams, playing miniature golf through Route 66 and going bonkers with the bumper cars. Plenty to offer in terms of family enjoyment. 

Ok, on to the negatives. (Sorry, Incredible Pizza Company.) The staff...eh, not very professional. I'm specifically thinking of the girl that checked us in and was unable to effectively tell us the difference between the ticket packages. This turned into a long and drawn out conversation that could have been easily avoided. Suggestion: learn how to sell the material in a nice fashion. The place itself was relatively clean - but nothing to brag about. This could be a really nice place for kids to enjoy, but market it as so. 

I had just gone to Sky Zone the day before, so maybe my ""fun"" expectations were a little too high?",10,163,105296,12.149999999999999
